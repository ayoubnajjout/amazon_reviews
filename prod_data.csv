A110ZEDSNASVCO,B0002GOK08,"Brother MOLOCH 969 ""MolochSorcery.com""","[0, 0]","I collect picks (or plectrums if you're a purist) and I do so for a good reason: I don't use the same pick for the same sort of playing style. I tend to use some picks for jazz; some for blues; some for metal and so on. Not all picks are made the same & some are far better than others.The Dava Master Control Pick (DMCP) is a very nice & useful pick. I've been enjoying it for heavy strumming (or as the metalheads call it, ""chuggin'""). I like its thin center and the way it is overall contoured which makes holding it a delight to my forefinger & thumb.Another thing I really like about it is the metal tip which some folks may not enjoy as it does give a bit of a metallic tone when it touches the strings. This is especially true when you've just replaced your old guitar's strings for new ones. Depends on how you like it or not whether you like that metallic ting - I do for certain passages.The pick's construction seems to be fairly rigid & yet it has potential to do more than merely chug again on the low E & A strings. DMCP is definitely a plectrum that I will be using a lot of in the future and not just for hard core metal but also for subtle tones in jazz passages with the distortion off.Overall I give the DMCP 5 out of 5 stars for being what it claimed it was and for being something that I will find great utility for in years to come.",5.0,NICE Pick for Stringed Instruments,1337558400,"05 21, 2012"
A110ZEDSNASVCO,B000KIRT6A,"Brother MOLOCH 969 ""MolochSorcery.com""","[1, 1]","I got this in the mail today and plugged it into my pedal board just prior to the amp. Like the other reviewers on here, I'm sad to report that it's quite 'hissy'. I had hoped that it would not be a hissing type of pedal but it is. I'm using a Line 6 Uber Metal, Boss Metal Zone, Ibanez LA Metal & Boss Compressor/Sustainer with my SKB pedal board. The board itself is not noisy at all with any of the other pedal cranked up BUT when I put the EQ700 in with the others, there's a noticeable hiss though not so much at low volume but when you crank the amp (I'm using a Peavey Special 212 Transtube combo) above 4, you can definitely hear the hiss. Not sure if a noise gate pedal would reduce this but I'm going to give the Danaelectro Fish & Chips (as recommended by another reviewer) a try.I'm waiting on the Behringer Orchestra Chorus pedal to arrive and HOPING it isn't hissy like the EQ700 is.I will say though I do like the tone influence this pedal has. It does a nice job of altering the tone & gives my rig a greater flexibility for sounds.Overall I give this pedal a 3 out of 5 stars.",3.0,It's....Okay,1298505600,"02 24, 2011"

A13NWJUMVNS6YZ,B000K69V5E,Coffee Drinker,"[4, 4]","I play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solid-body bass. I bought this Jim Dunlop MC401 MXR because I have a few bass solos that can't be heard above the other players unless I boost volume, which was hard to do by reaching for the volume knob on my preamp or amp with my hand. This stomp box lets me instantly add a pre-selected amount of volume boost only--no goofy effects, no hum, no extraneous sounds at all. Of course, when the solo is over, another click with my foot drops the boost. This thing sounds completely transparent when it's off, and completely natural when it's on. For my purposes, a boost of five decibels out of the 20 that this device permits seems to be enough. Naturally, you have to have left some head room available in your amp otherwise you won't hear any volume change or you'll get distortion or both, but that should be obvious--it's just like turning your amp up, except with your foot.The MC401 runs on a 9-volt battery, but I also separately ordered the Dunlop ECB003 AC adapter, which is also available at Amazon. I checked the Jim Dunlop website and in its FACs it specifically recommends staying with the same voltage adapter, so I did not order the ECB004, which is an 18-volt model. The ECB003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent.The MC401 is compacl, but it's heavily-constructed so it stays put. The stomp switch itself appears to be made of good steel, as is the case itself. Everything is solid as a rock. I don't see how it could be better.

My wife bought me this for Christmas, thinking I needed a new hobby to keep me busy during the harsh winter months.I am so happy she did.  My first thought was ""Now I have to learn how to play this thing"".  I am so glad she chose this particular guitar for me to start with.  I now own 26 guitars and have even built 2 custom guitars.  I always get carried away with new projects and can already play quite well, or so I'm told.  I practice a lot.Now about the guitar.  I wanted to wait until I knew a little something before I reviewed it.  First, I don't know how they sell these for the price they do.  It is a very high quality piece, comparable to guitars in the thousand dollar price range.The action is nice and low, good especially for a beginner.  I did find just the perfect strings and it made a world of difference.  I use light D'Addaro strings and love the tone and feel.The Yamaha is solid wood everywhere, no laminate as you'd expect for this price.  The tone is fantastic, the finish is flawless and tough.  It sounds great gently playing or really getting down and rough with it.  I have been strumming vigorously for over four months now and not a mark is on the guitar.  I have been playing many other guitars, all electric as well and am looking at a high end acoustic now, but will always keep my first.  There is no reason for me to need another acoustic, I just will because I can.This Yamaha has great tuners and stays in tune well, rarely having to make an adjustment once the strings are stretched.The neck is nice, though a bit thick so I cheat sometimes with my thumb on the low E.  The set-up was perfect with this and I just can't see where it's going to take much if any maintenance over the years other than replacing strings as needed.The Yamaha came with a great hard case, tuner, pics and other goodies as a package and was very inexpensive.  I did put a nice soft leather strap with a quick disconnect on it as there is no front strap button but no big deal there.If you're looking for a nice acoustic or thinking about taking up playing, this would be a great place to start.  I see these selling used for what I paid for mine new so you're bot going to lose money on it either.  Read the other reviews, this is a really nice value.  It is still my only acoustic that I own, my other 25 guitars are all electrics or project guitars.  I do have my eye on a Martin though.5 PLUS stars for this one.  If you're considering it, buy it.  You will not regret it.  I still play this on almost every day.",5.0,My first guitar and a great one to start with,1397433600,"04 14, 2014"

A1A15ECLHM9BQY,B000EEJAWQ,Nick,"[0, 0]","Here's what strap locks are supposed to do: securely attach your strap to your guitar. These do that much better than Schallers and the Fender rip-offs of Schaller.I used the Schallers many years ago. They look great, but the problem is they screw onto the strap with a nut. I am very good with maintenance, check for loose parts, etc., but at one gig with my super heavy American deluxe 5 string jazz bass, the nut worked its way off the strap, and I dropped it. It was with a heavy leather strap, and I did tighten it down with pliers upon installation and I'm sure I kept it maintained. Absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable. Never again. Unless you want to inspect and retighten your strap locks at every single rehearsal and gig, forget about Schallers. They're a good company and they make great tuners, I don't fault the materials, it's simply that threaded things can work their way loose, a fatal design flaw for this type of device. Come on, its only purpose is to not allow something to come off of something else.The Dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring. It is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident. If you're having trouble getting the lockrings on, I have a YouTube video posted to my channel, NickWeissMusic, just search for Dunlop strap lock installation. It's kind of tough at first but with experience, it's very easy. The package instructions are correct but not very helpful.I have these on more than 10 instruments, and have never had even close to a failure in well over a decade. The package recommends periodically lubricating the mechanism inside the lock, but I have never done so, in my experience lubricants usually gunk things up more than they help for things like this. I've never had so much as a grind or squeak from the button or ball bearings in these strap locks, if I did, I'd probably just replace it. I do give the locks a little tug when I put them on to make sure they're engaged, other than that, you can forget about them, which is the way it should be.The only possible downside is that these strap locks keep the strap a little further from the instrument then using no strap locks or the Schallers do, to which I say, who cares. Well, I guess a lot of people care about that, since I see it in a lot of reviews. If using no strap lock or a poorly designed one is worth it to you, just so you can have your strap a quarter inch closer to your guitar, so be it. I have seen Ernie Ball strap locks that seem to be a little lower profile, I think they use lock rings too. Maybe try those, but I'm sticking with the flawless track record of the Dunlops.",5.0,"The best value, work perfectly",1379548800,"09 19, 2013"

A1EX4410F46C8O,B0002CZVXM,"Matt32 ""LIGHT WEIGHT""","[0, 0]","A little story to back these lock's integrity.  I installed them on a Korean made Washburn WG-587v.  Incredible guitar after tweaking.  I did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying.  The strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder.  The screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar!  The screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood (and I epoxy all my screws in) before the strap lock broke.  Amazing.Nice, tough hardware.  The only complaint I have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided.  Easy to install, just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder.  Attach the lock to your strap and BAM quick release system.  Fast to take on and off of your guitar.I would suggest getting a tough, thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in, cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear.  Also, the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps.I have now switched over to DiMarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with Dunlop locks for many reasons and I am very happy, but this product is GRADE A!

I just couldn't bring myself to give them a 4/5 so I went with 3/5, here's why:I've used standard medium picks for over 20 years. Switching to these was not a problem at all. Sure, they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems. By far the biggest change was the &#34;pointy-ness&#34; of the picks. The distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing, especially when playing chords. Everything is much more pronounced, which isn't necessarily a good thing in my opinion. It's especially bad when playing clean electric (picking notes or strumming).If someone was to ask me if these are good picks, my answer would be &#34;it depends.&#34; It really does, in my opinion, it depends on what you're playing. From a rhythm standpoint, I don't like these at all - they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me. For lead work they are OK because you can really dig into each note and have it come through.Could I play faster with them? No. Could I pull off amazing licks that I couldn't do with my normal picks? No.I tried them, but didn't like them. Maybe if you typically play a TON of lead work, constantly, these would be the way to go. I don't, and they aren't for me.

I had purchased two, which I have now given away to student players as I cannot use them.  I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar.  The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. Both capos had this very same problem.When I received these capos, I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos.  The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos.  The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product.  As a professional musician, I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I can't afford to have my gear failing during performances.

To be honest, I was very, very impressed with their feel and handling. I do think they're the best playing strings I've used when it comes to pure playability. Hands down, none better. They were butter-smooth and great for flat picking. But for me it was a trade-off, because I simply wasn't impressed with the tone. I even took the time to try them on three different guitars (all dreadnoughts): a classic maple sides/spruce top, a mahogany back/sides with spruce top, and a maple backs/sides with a nato top. On all three, I didn't like the tone as much as the strings I was using. I really wanted to like them, but they simply didn't have the tone of the medium gauge Martin SPs I normally use.This isn't to say they're not great strings that sound different on other peoples' guitars, but I simply didn't like them on mine. I love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music I play in our jam group. The Elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the Martin strings I use, and the treble sounds tinny vs. the clear ring of the Martins I normally use. To be fair, the bass strings sound great, and aren't much different. I would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you're going to use them. I play in acoustic groups, and the Elixir strings just don't have what I need to be heard, in spite of how great they feel under your fingers. If playability is more important than great tonal range, then by all means buy these strings...you won't be disappointed. I'm guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric, where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones.",3.0,"Great feel and handling, but not the sound I like",1391558400,"02 5, 2014"

A1XNCV67JBJVF7,B0002F52EW,Sam Beckett,"[1, 1]","I am a professional musician, keyboard player, and keyboard collector (mostly vintage poly analog, but also a ton of mono phonics, modulars, and built your own kit units (shrugging, ambik-) etc - not that that has a lot to do with a pedal, however, I do live the life of a person surrounded by keyboard instruments that I use to make my living.  have purchased every brand and style of pedal (for the purpose of this, we'll stick with sustain.).Compared to other units, it is heavier than most and I find the point where sustain engages to be just about right comparing electronic to acoustic.  It is just an on/off switch, so no half modeling here,The only reason I gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5 is because Yamaha decided not to include a polarity switch and alienate perhaps 20% of the market who will get home and , if they hadn't thought to check, may be stuck wi a pedal that sustains when not being used and stops sustaining when pressed.  A backward sustain pedal is not fun.  Many manufacturers include a simple polarity reverse  switch that would eliminate that potential headache.These days, most keyboards have the option to switch polarity internally either thru a global bemusement or by sensing whether the pedal is engaged at startup and adjusting accordingly (never press the sustain pedal while turning your keyboard on, you may very well cause an issue you don't expect and are confused by - turning on and off again without the pedal depressed will clear everything up in those cases.)So - build quality, excellent.  Durability - excellent (I've had a bunch of cheaper pedals - used on stage - break  at the switch point or at the jack), this Yamaha endures.  Design - some older pedals used to have a flip out rubber footrest that was supposed to make the pedal more secure- I don't see that much anymore, but, so long as you aren't on glossy hardwood, this will stay I place with no issue.I've read a few reviews that give this pedal a bad rating because of what appears to be a change in a global setting on a keyboard, or something similar,  All a sustain pedal consist of is a momentary contact switch, engaged when contact is made by depressing and completing the circuit, and disengaged when the pedal is released.  There are no electronics - so - if it doesn't work, there are three points to look at 1) unscrew the jack and be sure that the wires coming from the pedal are all  connected to the metal posts inside the housing. There are usually two wires of differing color.  if one is disconnected, the pedal will cease to function (and, in rare instances, cause the keyboard to sustain all notes indefinitely.  This is easily corrected with a soldering iron and a bit if solder - jacks are points of strain so it isn't inconceivable that a wire could come disconnected. 2) The switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged.  The switches in the Yamaha pedals are of good quality and unless you received a faulty part, would be unlikely to wear out with normal use. I have, however, needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment.  this was easy and a quick fix, even with limited tools.  The third option is 3) the keyboard has had a change in a global setting causing the pedal t operate in reverse.  This can be corrected by consulting your owners manual and reading whether your keyboard has a software polarity &#34;switch&#34;, if it senses on startup, or if you pedal simply stopped working altogether - doing nothing At all - it is #1 or 2 or a problem with the jack on the keyboard (HIGHLY unlikely,,but I've seen it happen.). Hopefully this helps some who have posted questions.To conclude - a nice pedal for the money, much better build than the m-audio (decent, just not as nice as the Yamaha - certainly not a bad unit)/on stage (if they can't get most of their mic stands right, I don't trust them with even basic electronics...) or generics.",4.0,"Heavy duty, well constructed single tongue pedal.",1378080000,"09 2, 2013"

Go go, Amazon!  lulz  Anyhoo, I have two banjos and a mandolin that I purchased this for.  I looked about for quite a bit at various sites, reviews, prices, etc, and pretty much Hercules got the best reviews everywhere (although admittedly I hadn't really wanted to shell out over 50 dollars).  Yet this tri-stand really looked good with a solid general review, and I am rather tight for space overall (think trailer home size).  I wanted a way to hold my instruments in one place without having to work around gig-bags or hard cases taking up limited 'living space'. As it stands (figuratively and literally), the Hercules Tri-Stand does the job excellently with the two banjos.  All three instruments are varying heights, the resonator bluegrass banjo being the longest, and (naturally) the mandolin being the shortest, with a open back clawhammer banjo in the middle.The three 'back-rest' fold outs are static, attached to a center ring, and you ""can"" adjust them independently a *little up and down*, but not to compensate for such a length difference between a bluegrass banjo and a mandolin.  However, the mandolin is a really lite thing, so I suspect it will be fine just hanging there by the peg head without a 'back-rest' as long as the stand isn't jostled around.  In my own case, aside from two rather lazy cats and pending no sudden hip-smash-oops by me, that shouldn't be an issue.  And of course, considering I am looking at a possible third banjo, the mandolin may just go live in its case after all...Now a word about open back banjos, if you are considering this stand... First off, no, I was not going to rest the coordinator rod against the 'back-rest' (just seems like a bad idea).  What I ended up doing was adjusting the 'back-rests' so the resonator of the bluegrass banjo rested about an inch up from the bottom, allowing the open back to rest on the other side ON TOP of the rest, along the lip of the banjo rim, at the edge of the rest foam where it begins to curve out and down. The tail-piece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing.  Seems pretty solid in this position while still engaging the weight clamps up at the top.I give it 5 stars mainly based on the excellent quality of the stand and the fact that it is the ONLY three instrument stand worth any kind of hoot I have been able to find.  Its not the absolute perfect thing for my own application (would need the three 'back-rests' to be independently adjustable in height for that), but overall I am extremely pleased with it.",5.0,2 Banjos and a Mandolin,1314576000,"08 29, 2011"

It sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches.As for using pedals with it, it will take distortion to a degree. It reaches a point, if pushed too hard, at which the definition of the distortion will begin turning mushy and shrill. You can use a distortion + overdrive to decent effect, especially if you are running a cleaner sounding OD like a Tube Screamer. I don't think it would do so well with a Bad Monkey, for example, though, which has more dirt in the tones it produces. I don't have a fuzz box (not yet, but have one on order), but I think most fuzzes will sound like crap unless you use a relatively cleaner, sweeter one like the Red Witch Fuzz God or the Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz. Otherwise, you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound.My wah wah, a Morley Power Wah, was almost useless with it. The limited frequency response of the 5"" speaker made it sound overly throaty on cleans and when I put the boost in the shrillness would show itself again.A chorus pedal sounds totally sweet on it, but a phaser, in my case, a Phase 90, just destroys the sound. A flanger is also not really advisable. You can use delay, just not with very rapid repeats. Putting a compressor in front of your clean signal would probably make it more manageable for the Pignose' speaker. I just bought a Dynacomp, but haven't tried it on the piggy.This is a good cheap first amp to buy for a youngster who is just beginning their journey on guitar and for practice when you are on the road on vacation or business.

Put a crimp or bend in each string about 3/4 of an inch or so from the ball at the end, about 45 degrees from the straight portion of the string, fairly sharp. Just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on. Then push the ball into the hole and make sure the crimped portion of the string is slid up against the wall of the hole closest to the neck of the guitar, out of the way of the pin. Then slide in the pin and make sure the ball is not resting on the bottom of the pin! The pin should fit tightly into the hole, and the crimp you made in the string keeps the ball on the side of the pin, not below it. Each pin has a groove in it where the string passes into the hole on the side of the pin. After pushing in the pin, you can pull on the string in the direction of the nut, and the ball should be pressing the pin sideways in the hole, keeping it tight. It may be under or on the side of the bridge inside the guitar, but I can't see in there to verify this is so, but I know that the ball is pressing sideways on the pin!

I've used many different types of picks over the years and I've not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far it's just a case of getting used to it.  This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat, stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face.  The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard.  This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing.

Platt ""UpIrons""","[6, 6]","I have an ESP guitar with a slanted headstock that had a hard time fitting into the gig bag that the music store threw in when I got the guitar. After buying a line-6 pocket pod and some good studio headphones there was simply no room left in that old bag.Found this bag and liked the fact that it has so many front pockets and it really looked like it would fit all of my gear, cables, etc. I originally put it on my wish list because I will admit, you don't always want to spend your own money on stuff like this but my wife ended up surprising me with this and it was a great surprise.My guitar fits perfectly. It used to be a struggle getting my guitar in the old gig bag and zipping it shut. As mentioned, the curved headstock makes the guitar taller and the old gig bag always had the pointed tip of the headstock poking out of it because it just would not close.But this big closes all the way and it does have so much more padding than my previous bag. And the pockets - OH THE POCKETS! They fit ALL of my gear. I have my guitar cable, a set of full size sennheiser headphones, a line 6 pocket pod, all the allen wrenches, a tuner, and my tremelo neatly organized in all the separate pockets. And there is room for more if I need it!The bag does smell a little funky the first few days but it didn't stink up the house like some reviewers mentioned. Just open it up and let it air out in a part of the house where it won't bother anyone and it's fine after a day or two.One last thing about this bag is that it has a handle right up near the headstock. I did not know this but wow I had no idea how useful that could be. I tend to carry my guitar, in bag, up and down stairs a lot and being able to hold it in two places is extremely useful. Then you have the backpack handles as an option as well. I really cannot recommend this bag enough. I do agree with the other user who said the log on it is a little kiddie like, but I don't really care, the bag is too perfect for me to be bothered by that, and while the padding is great, I would not recommend this bag for checking your bag for air travel. It would be fine if you use it as a carry on but would not protect much in checked baggage, in case you want it for that kind of thing. I don't travel long distances with my guitar but if I did, I would use a hard case only for that as I have seen too many horror stories of smashed guitars on airlines lately.Hope that helps anyone out there looking for a gig bag with tons of room for your gear!",5.0,Perfect Bag for Me,1357862400,"01 11, 2013"

When I saw that I could get the mic from Alto Music, it was a no brainer. I was purchasing from my local music store through Amazon. As for the mic, it's an SM7b, and it's everything I was looking for, despite it being a low output mic. It's smooth, has a sexy low end color, has no harshness, brittleness, or high frequency unpleasantness that can occur with some condensers. I'm recording in an untreated basement, and this mic is perfect for when I'm singing loud rock stuff; it only picks up what's right in front of it and none of the room. I'm using a Focusrite 2i2, which is great for loud singing, but I'm picking up a Cloudlifter for some more clean quiet gain to use this mic on acoustic guitars and softer vocals as well.

A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN,B0002CZVBE,Charlo,"[1, 1]","For the money, I have no complaints.  The enclosure, dials, and footswitch are all durable.  Not true bypass, but none of the BOSS pedals are.  It doesn't suck tone.  This pedal isn't the end-all be-all overdrive, but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that TS pedals don't. You lose a little low end when it is engaged, but that actually works pretty well for leads- especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of 'classic' distortion encountered with EL84s.  As a stand alone overdrive, I prefer other pedals.  But where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp.  You get singing, harmonic leads when it is dialed in right.  Like any overdrive, you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far.  I am a dirtbox hoarder and I like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations.  Lately, I am running this into either the V1 Cool Cat transparent overdrive (Timmy Clone - very, very nice) or the Behringer BO-100 (which is a dead ringer for the Boss Blues Driver) then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch (Jet City Combo or Palomino Combo).  As with any overdrive, this thing will not sound very good (IMHO) running into a solid state amp.  That's just not what it was intended to do. It was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but YMMV. Because I'm a cheapskate (and because these things are durable like bricks) I bought it used for $20, but it is well worth the new asking price.",4.0,Nice pedal !,1348012800,"09 19, 2012"

High end modlers (Line 6, G Dec, Vox VT) that can still run $400+ and are typically overloaded with features. The low end tubes (Fender Blues Junior, Bug V22, Peavey Valveking, etc). These typically are more stripped down (in features, not neccessarily quality). And then there are the micros. I always thought they were just a notch above toys, the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from Wally World at Christmas.Boy was I wrong...I needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school. It was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear. He's not a big kid, so even 15lb. amps are pushing it(plus a gig bag and school back pack). That was initially what brought me to the Micro. Not sound or features, just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso. Turns out this is an AMAZING amp. The tone destroys the Line 6 and the features crush the Vox Pathfinder (6watt?) or Bug V12. And the Fender frontman - not even in the ballpark.Each of the models are distinct. The cleans are sparkly (more trebly) and the high gain models are very articulate. Obviously this isn't a loud amp, but that's not all bad. You can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes. It also can be battery powered (the life is suprisingly long), includes a regular wall plug, headphone jack, built in tuning fork (which is kind of lame) and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously.

I would happily bail on Elixir at $13 a set if someone offered a cheaper option that worked as well. In fact, I was quite optimistic about the $9 D'Addario EXPs until I heard their tone begin to evaporate after a few days like any other string. Nothing that I've used up to this point has gotten close to challenging the quality of the mighty purple box.The sound you get from these on Day 1 is crisp and beautiful as expected. That's not where Elixirs kill the competition though. It's after 20 hours of play that they show their strength. You will still hear fresh, bright tones from them when any other set would have already crossed into the dead zone. In fact, I typically start breaking them before they begin to sound too dull. I play relatively aggressively and use palm-muting constantly, allowing skin oils to eat right through the strings at the bridge.Saying that the tone lasts 3.5x longer (as stated on the box) might be a stretch but there is no question that you get at least double the life out of these at less than twice the cost of alternatives.If you are an occasional player or a music shop owner, these are a no-brainer. The coating is extremely effective at combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure. For the everyday, aggressive player you will simply get better tone and longer life.One nit-picky point of criticism: the packaging is an issue for me. WHY would any manufacturer still utilize tree-killing paper envelopes that allow strings to get stale? I'm seriously asking! I've got to be missing something here. A shred of plastic sealed around all 6 strings is greener, more cost-efficient, and it keeps the strings fresh (thank YOU D'Addario, I'll never leave your electric strings). I would happily buy Elixirs in bulk if I had faith in their shelf-life. Complaints about these snapping prematurely are probably valid, happening when someone gets a set that's been sitting around for a while.

Since it isn't my primary instrument and I don't play bass live (well, not yet), it never made sense to invest in a bass amp.  I bought this to liven up the tone when recording, in the hope of removing some of the sterility of a bass plugged directly into a firewire interface.  It does the job; makes the sound warmer and more amp-like.Honestly, if you've been doing some homework about this thing, you should know what to think of it.  Behringer's build quality can be dubious sometimes, but overall their stuff produces sounds that should satisfy anyone who isn't a picky audiophile.  This box is no exception.

A356RFKNIG043B,B0002E1O5E,K. Swanson,"[6, 9]","After all these reviews I expected the Greatest Strings Ever, golden strands of Glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection!Instead, I got a decent set of .10's that lasted a whole hour before the D snapped at the neck pickup. I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and I pre-stretch them gently but completely. Plus I tune down to Eb for vocal and breakage reasons, so I break very few of my normal strings, Slinky .10's. Ergo, a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension, tuned down, is unacceptable, especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings.As for the tone, it's definitely bright and almost too edgy, but nicely zingy all told. Yet one negative I've noticed after about 8 hours' loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings, making them harder to tune. Sounds odd, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles ain't cheap either at triple the price, please note), I've since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir strings.So, I must say I'm summarily unimpressed so far with Elixir electric strings.What's the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast?Especially when it costs three times more?And what's up with the tuning thing?And why do these cost so much more, anyhow? Is a micro-thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string? Not when that string is toast in 50 minutes, zero doubt there.Anyhow, I've got five Elixirs and one Slinky on my main ax now, so as they age I'll get a good feel for how the Elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone, and I'll report back here in a while. And by the way, that Slinky D sounds almost exactly the same as the Elixirs, tonally. So much for Magic Elixir Tone.Don't get me wrong, I really do want to love these, as I hate changing strings, but geez guys, how about some quality control?If I'm going to pay triple the price, then is it crazy to expect triple the quality? Or heck, even just a little better...PS If you look at the D'Addario reviews (I love their acoustic strings), they respond to many of the reviews and questions. I hope that Elixir will do the same here and address my questions.[Edit: And now, after only six hours' of playing on that guitar, the B string popped at the same place as the D, neck pickup. Once again I ask: what good are strings that ""sound good three times longer"" if they break three times faster?][Edit: 10/31/12. Come on! After four more hours, the A string went. I only play that ax one or two sessions a week, and the next time I joked to the drummer, ""Which one will go today?"" He said he's amazed the G is still on, as he plays too and knows the G takes the most tension. An hour later, guess what? Yep. So that's four broken strings in less than 20 hours' play. Seriously?Not only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks, I'd be bummed if they cost 3 bucks. The only plus I can think of at this point is they sounded good when new, but dang, unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such, I'd stick with Slinkies or D'Addarios. Unless I got a ""bad set"", which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price. In any case, these Elixirs were just not worth the money.][Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple breakage, and they sent me another set. That set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet, thought the tuning issue remains. I'll add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud. But honestly, at this price, there should be no duds at all.]",3.0,Not very impressed so far,1347235200,"09 10, 2012"

Stick an SM-57 in front of it and fool a lot of people into thinking it's a tube amp. By working your guitar knobs you can get a clean sound, along with that ""barely breaking up"" holy grail of tone for many blues and rock players.By learning how much you can do with relatively little, you'll gain a new appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of all the tone-shaping tools that have come along since.It might surprise those who take today's hyper-saturated, over-processed metal distortion for granted as the official, community-sanctioned guitar tone to discover the challenges and pleasure of touch and response with subtle dynamics and without infinite sustain.One bit of weirdness: When I began playing my Pignose I immediately noticed a buzz, as though something small was rattling around between the speaker cone and front grill. The four mounting nuts were easy to loosen and, sure enough, an extra washer had gotten caught in there during assembly. Fortunately it slid right out and there was no damage.Get the power adapter and save the batteries for when you absolutely have no choice.The first amp I ever had was a small Ampeg tube from the early 60's with a single 6 inch speaker, volume and tone knobs. I've no idea how many watts it put out - not enough for my parents to complain from their bedroom next door. With that baby cranked, I spent many happy hours in tone heaven.

The coating is incredibly subtle, almost impossible to feel on the strings. I like that. Compared to Elixir's these are a bit brighter, with good feel.Call me old school, I hate the packaging. These strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag. Ah, you know I'm just so used to strings that are individually looped. Two strings looped together makes a mess while I'm restringing a guitar - when I unwrap that pair, I've got a string that has to sit out unwrapped on the bench. The neat freak in me hates that. I also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag. Yeah I get it; they are trying to be more environmentally responsible. But darn it, 6 paper envelopes? It feels to me like they are just trying to cheapen up the packaging materials, not some environmental cause. 100% post-consumer recycled paper adds very little to the environmental load.I know D'Addario loves the color coded ends. On my acoustic guitar that's irrelevant, the ends are hidden inside the guitar behind the pegs. On my electric guitars, I don't like the look at all. I prefer gold or silver rings at the end. If the strings are in individual labeled packages, there's no need for the colors.D'Addario loves the color coded end rings so much, they do a horrible job color coding and simplifying their packaging. I have yet to decode their colors or naming system.I normally use 10 gauge strings in my acoustic guitar. I tested these at 12 gauge and am surprised how much I like them. The slightly thicker string is not bad.Oddly these strings are priced almost the same as Elixir's. My reason for using the original D'Addario strings is low price - if somebody is doing gigs nightly, those uncoated strings are the only way to go. Strings end up being changed long before corrosion becomes an issue for the gigging musician. For the home enthusiast, coated strings make a ton of sense, they do last longer. I think they are worth the premium price. Now there are two choices for excellent coated strings.In the end, the packaging, the color coded end rings, the crazy package coding, and the double looped strings all mean nothing once the strings are on the guitar. What they sound like and play like is the most important thing. And in that regard these are excellent strings.",5.0,Excellent Strings,1367798400,"05 6, 2013"

A3FW4THIMBIN6V,B0002CZVXM,"Jeffrey A. Hawkins ""HumanJHawkins""","[7, 9]","I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1"" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!",2.0,Disappointing Quality and Engineering,1306886400,"06 1, 2011"

A3I49HMI4LV6HU,B0002HLL8G,medialint,"[0, 0]","I put these on my ""campfire acoustic"" Black Yamaha F335 and they look stunning. The tone seems slightly brighter, however, I go through strings pretty fast so a lot of the difference I am hearing is admittedly likely a result of going from dead strings to new strings. Since they are replacing plastic pins I am going to skip scientific analysis and give you a subjective ""sounds good"".These pins are a little thin (small) so they may slide out of the hole easier than the ones they are replacing. If you need to this should be remedied handily by applying a small amount of tape to the pins. This may not be necessary, however, even if they are slightly loose because the pins when used correctly are not a wedge to keep the string in the hole. The string should go all the way through the hole, into the body of the guitar. Insert the string so that you are sure the ball is inside the body at least a few inches, if possible it should be listing toward the neck. Then insert the pin with the slot facing the neck and push it in firmly. Unless you have really thick strings these slots should be ample for this. Then gently pull the string tight making sure that the ball does not grab the end of the pin. Instead it should be up against the body of the guitar and stopped from escaping back up the hole by the pin. The pin itself should not really be holding it in place all on its own. Usually the pins popping out are because the ball is actually hooked onto the end of the pin and is pulling it up out of the hole. If you avoid this you should also avoid the frustrating mishap of having the pin come flying out and poking you in the eye while you're trying to get your guitar in tune (typically ruining a brand new string in the process). If you can get your hand inside the guitar and feel the ball end of the string you should be able to feel how it it sitting against the body (correctly) or hanging on the pin (incorrectly). Also your tone and tuning stability will be improved by making sure you have a proper string installation.These fit my guitar snugly but not tightly, however I do not have problems with them popping out despite the fact that I do a lot of string bending a whole step or more (sometimes using two fingers' strength to bend that far).

From experimenting over the years, I've found that, while I have ""old standbys"" that will be the first thing I try, often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar.Coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years.  They're expensive, but they last a lot longer, especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly.  Also, they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the strings.Elixir Polywebs were the first coated string.  The coating is much heavier than that of other strings.  This produces a much less bright, more muted sound.  I have an old koa guitar that is so bright I can't stand it with standard strings.  The Elixir Polywebs tone it down to the point where it's perfect.If you're looking for a darker sound, then Elixir Polywebs are definitely worth a shot.

Other reviewers said that the two level controls only work if are using this pedal for a one in to two out situation (one guitar to two amps). That is definitely correct. In a two in (two guitars to one amp) situation only one level control works which isn't bad if you need to compensate for any volume loss from the pedal.

I often read these reviews that complain about the low quality of Behringer stuff and the plastic case on the effects pedals but I have yet to damage one of the pedals and I admit that I am not that careful with my live equipment. This stuff is the best bargain on the market. Are my Behringer Eurolive active P.A. speakers as good as my Mackie SRM450 speakers. No, but the Behringers cost about $250.00 each while my Mackie's cost twice as much.

At first I was skeptical because it's lightweight and the cutting ends are not sharp. I was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings. I'm happy to say that it does an excellent job, much better than the pair of diagonal pliers I was using.  It cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly.  It's nice not having to carry the pliers around, which are heavier and a little risky to your guitar should you happen to drop it or accidentally mar your headstock. As for the bridge pin puller, I tried it once but it is rather ineffective. I think it was included more as an afterthought as it's just a notched edge and can't really pull stuck pins. For pulling bridge pins without damaging the bridge I would recommend the Dunlop bridge pin puller which is inexpensive.Overall I give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter.

ADH0O8UVJOT10,B0002CZV7I,StormJH1,"[3, 5]","It really pains me to give anything but a 5-star review to a BOSS product, since I'm such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall.  Those compliments apply equally to the CS-3 Compression Sustainer.  And it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less-reliable brand in my signal chain.However, there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know.  The two most common complaints that I see are that it adds ""noise"" to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit.  The former complaint is probably true, though if you're enough of a hobbyist to use a Compression Sustainer, you're probably already contemplated using a noise gate/suppressor, such as the BOSS NS-2.  Problem solved.As for the latter complaint (changes tone), that's also true, but it's not necessarily a bad thing if you LIKE the tone that results.  The whole point of the CS-3 is that it's supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it.  This can result in a muddy, ""neutered"" tone, though you can play with the TONE and other settings to help it.  I also find that with the settings all at 12 O'Clock, the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings.Really, while BOSS pedals are considered to be ""expensive"" compared to many of the other effects out there, the CS-3 should really be viewed as a ""budget"" or ""entry level"" compressor, when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a Keeley Compressor costing north of $200.  The best thing you can say about the BOSS (even compared to the similarly-priced MXR options) is that the CS-3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price.  The biggest negative of the pedal, in my opinion, is that the resulting sound might seem a little too...compressed.But there are a lot of things you could do with a CS-3, and it works best paired with other pedals (chorus, delay, some distortions) that you're trying to smooth out.  Ultimately, it's a pedal that could have been better, though there aren't too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of $100 anyway.",4.0,"Good, but not great sustain/leveler effect from BOSS",1346112000,"08 28, 2012"

Anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play, free prime two day shipping, no sales tax, and saved about $80 in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store.  The savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new Mustang 2 v2 amplifier.The only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box.  This one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer.  It is not a big deal to me but I thought I'd mention it for those thinking of buying a epiphone.  When I ordered this one I wasn't really sure if a cable would be included or not so I ordered one at the same time, I'm glad I did.",5.0,very happy with my les paul,1376870400,"08 19, 2013"

A1365RYO0BLEMI,B001L8KE06,John Barry,"[2, 2]","That's not to brag but to illustrate my experience with AMPS. Everything you can imagine. This AMP ranks up there with the best of them. I'm surprised as I've hated (with a passion) every DSP solid state amp I've ever played. This hybrid is incredible. The effects are excellent. The built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording. It has many onboard effects but I have racks and pedals that outdo those, so I don't use them for recording.It's not a band amp unless you're an acoustic band or your drummer has electronic drums. It's 15 Watts, but it's loud... it's just not quite loud enough to get those cleans over the drums, though you might be fine for overdrive -- depending on the venue and situation.It's not going to emulate certain amps like a VOX very well, but it does excellent with a Fender Black face (excluding the tube reverb). It does a Bassman ok, but doesn't quite capture that chime and nuisances tone of the original '59 Bassman. Doesn't cost $11,000 dollars other. It does a Marshall pretty well. Marshall's based on '59 Bassman without the delicate touch, so there's no wonder. The acoustic gives a very clean sound and makes that clean sound more full, yet doesn't sound like a filter. 0, 6, 7, 9 and 12 are amazing voices. You can bypass that and use  it without effects or voicing and it sounds a lot like the original Super Champ.I also have a 2x12 Vintage 30 box I connect it to for even more of a wonderful fully dynamic and full rich sound. When I'm just playing around the house or need a quick recording and don't wanna have to dial in sounds with my Vox AC30 or Fender Deluxe Reverb then this my amp of choice. It is miles ahead of a Fender Blues Deluxe.Yes, this is indeed the best amp you will find for the price and the most versatile amp I've played outside of a $2000 mesa boogie.Buy it. In fact, buy two.

A13NWJUMVNS6YZ,B0018TIADQ,Coffee Drinker,"[1, 1]","I feared that this stand was not big enough for my guitarr&oacute;n which is at least as big as, but much thicker than, a cello. But its design appeared amenable to some home-modification that might make it work, so at the price I took a chance and bought it. Well, the back of my guitarr&oacute;n bulges out like a blowfish, so the neck could not lay back into the upper fork, but it turned out that when this stand is fully extended, my guitarr&oacute;n's body is very gently clamped between the upper and lower forks, like they were made for that. No modifications needed, not even bending.Some reviewers have said that the slightest bump will knock this stand over, but I suspect that none of those reviewers had all three legs COMPLETELY open and therefore extended to its widest base. If you don't really LOOK closely as you open the legs, you'll think you've reached the stop before the legs are fully open. I didn't have it fully open at first, and it was a just a bit too easy to push over, in my view, but still acceptable. When I discovered that I still had to open all three legs a bit more, I retried it and it was much more steady. That last 1/4"" (6.3mm) of movement on each leg was worth 100% improvement. The stand is fully as steady as I had hoped it possibly could be, especially given the price. Amazing.Anyway, I gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all.

A14JBDSWKPKTZA,B008BPI2HE,"Bob Feeser ""MillCrafters.com""","[23, 24]","I have been playing guitar for longer than I care to admit. Back in 1966 I went into the music store with my Dad and cherry picked the finest Fender Telecaster in the whole store. Back then they were all handmade, so there were variations, and by spending some time, would yield you an incredible find. So I am not a newbie to playing, or working on guitars. I didn't use this capo on my 66 because I have it apart in order to make exact vintage reproductions of the body.Today's modern guitars use medium jumbo frets. My 66 had thin frets. With the medium jumbo frets they are sufficiently high, that if you check them once fretting a note with something as accurate as the Snark SN 2 All Instrument Clip on Chromatic Tuner you will see that the note moves up one or two bars on the tuner once you fret it. (That is one or two bar above the note you are then fretting) So I must admit my quest for the perfect capo would enable me to adjust it so that the guitar doesn't go out of tune when using a capo.I compared the G7 Performance Capo the Six String Silver, with the Schubb S1 Stainless Steel Guitar Capo for Steel String Guitars, and this Planet Waves NS-Tri-action capo. Although the G7 was substantially built and looked rather impressive, I found it to be too bulky, so it kept getting in the way while trying to play chords. So I sent it back. So now it comes down to the Shubb 1 Deluxe and the Planet Waves. I went back and forth with these two tuners a whole lot of times. I would perfectly tune the guitar with the Snark and then apply the capo. I tried to discern the difference between which one of these would make the guitar go out of tune more than the other. I finally concluded that there was no difference.The Schubb S1 had the ability to be adjusted so fine that it would barely be holding on to the neck. If you set that one at its gentlest setting you could get it to be almost perfectly in tune even with the capo on, but set it that softly, and it would just about fall off the guitar. So that is the last thing that you want to happen in the middle of a performance. The Planet Waves Capo in contrast, even at the lightest setting, was still a solid grip on the neck. I also noticed that the planet waves had a wider spread across the strings and therefore was less critical of the positioning in order to get it right.The Schubb S1 is a well-made product, it has nicely finished metal components, but with its roller ball system of fastening, when you loosen it, for sure you're going to occasionally be dropping it in on the floor. You could say that requires two hands in order to remove it. The Planet Wave on the other hand is a true one-handed tool that makes it easy to remove and to put back on. I tried both of these on one of my other Fender telecasters, as well as on one of my acoustics. I got the same tuning results on all of them. I am very critical and exact so when I say that the tuning results would change when you put on the capo you must understand, that the tuner was only moving one line. Most people wouldn't even bother with that much of an adjustment but I know that there is nothing to compare to a guitar with good strings on it, and to hear the tone and the blend of those strings in perfect tune; perfect harmony rules. You know that feeling when you come to the end of a great song, and you hit your last note and finish with a full chord that is perfectly in tune; there is nothing to compare to it.The planet wave is a little bit bulkier and if I had to get critical of it I would say it does get in the way a tiny bit more than the Schubb S1; although this factor is not such a great difference, as to preclude me choosing one over the other. The way each of them mount and dismount to the guitar does make me lean more strongly to the Planet Waves.I saw other reviews that commented that one type of capo provided a better tone than another type of capo. Tried as I might I could not reproduce the differences that they spoke of. There are so many factors affecting the tone, such as after changing the capo was a guitar body leaning a little bit more one way, then it was the last time. For example was the face of the guitar a little closer to the ear range as compared to the last capo you tested that might've been projecting more from the side of the guitar. I also felt that once the capo squeezes the string down the only thing that is creating tone is the fret line between it and the bridge. So at least between these two I found no total differences.I wanted to say that if you are using medium sized jumbo frets and high action you are really bending the string in order to fret it thereby changing the pitch. I love low action with no buzzing on lighter gauge strings. I'd rather dance across the top like a ballet dancer then scrub heavy gauge strings. To each his own they say. I just consider it important to let you know that I'm conducting this experiment with 8 gauge strings on the Tele electric and 9 gauge on the acoustic. So if you're running a much heavier gauge string with lower action, you would of course have less tuning shift going on, because you could adjust the capo (and both of these have a round adjusting knob for fine-tuning) and be able to adjust it to the point where you are pressing just beyond the level of the frets and not really squeezing it all the way down on the fret board and therefore have less of a challenge in trying to keep it in tune while using a capo. (Although I doubt many are setting it that way but rather squeezing it down to the fret board instead.) Although it is possible with heavy gauge strings that you can fine tune the pressure sufficiently that it will yield a tuned instrument while under the load of the heavier gauge strings creating a strong enough grip at this finer setting so it won't slide off of the guitar like the Shubb does at its lighter setting.Of course all this is predicated upon you not re-tuning the guitar when you change the capo position. That really is the only way to create a perfectly tuned instrument and that is to do a little tweaking when you change the capo position. I'm sure most people ignore that and consider the ever so slightly out of tune instrument is something that is not objectionable and doesn't impede the overall quality of their performance. I find on the other hand, that a guitar which is perfectly in tune takes the music to a level that is not possible no matter how little or much it is out of tune.So I conclusion I find the planet waves easier-to-use and with its longer arm capable of a wider fret board, while at the same time capable of the thinner fret boards as well, as being the one that I highly recommend. Notwithstanding the Shubb places a very close second, and with its slightly smaller size, it does in fact get in the way a little less than the Planet Waves. All in all they both are the best of all the ones I've tried.",5.0,"Capo Shootout Between the Planet Waves, G7th Performance Capo, and the Shubb S1.",1361318400,"02 20, 2013"

I have to say this string cleaner is a must have!  I say this because in the long run, it will save you money on strings, save you time with changes, and will keep your strings sounding alive.Most guitarists don't realize just what they are doing to their strings when they play.  You are leaving behind a world of sweat, dead skin, and all kinds of nasty elements.  The oils/fluids you leave behind can be very acidic and contain plenty of things that will build up and corrode your strings.  I've seen people who change strings every week because the strings keep going dead.  I've seen mold and and all kinds of garbage build up on strings so bad I thought a sloth may be living on it.  This little tool will prevent that.I have a routine with mine. Before I play, I run the cleaner over the strings a few times.  Whenever I'm done playing I make sure to spray a string cleaner fluid onto the pad and run it over the strings again until I feel they are completely clean.  You will not believe the extension of your string life or the quality of sound you will get following these cleaning practices.Someone has mentioned in their review the fret damage that the string cleaner caused and I too thought about that the first time I used it.  I suggest pulling up a little bit so that the cleaner does not touch the frets.  Toward the nut where it is hard to get the cleaner in, I just wipe down with a rag.

Please don't purchase this thinking it will work for a standard acoustic or probably even an acoustic bass.  Amazon should have clarified in their item description.  Thanks for the comments educating me and sorry for the misleading review.**I'm not a very tall person and this strap is just incredibly short.

The accuracy is impressive and this pedal even worked well with the low B.I read all over bass forums and reviews of the tuner and thought to try it out.

I chose to keep the clear film over the display for now to preserve the display as long as I can. I tested this sweep option on an old Ibanez artcore guitar which hasn't been played for years and even with old strings, I got a reasonable tune out of it.Strumming all strings at once seems to work better with a guitar more than a bass, but many reviews in bass mags and online also point this out although it works for a quick tune.I am happy with the pedal and hope it lasts as long as my old Boss TU-2.

A1QDSJZQWJZOL1,B001CJ2QZU,T. Cox,"[2, 3]","This is the one pedal I can't do without. You can sculpt your guitar tone before it hits your amp, and that's the key to getting a tight rhythm tone at high gain. So if I encounter an amp that isn't tight enough, or the high gain distortion doesn't sound good by itself, I just turn down the gain or use a lower gain channel, and then hit it hard with this pedal. Sounds so much better than the internal high gain distortion.Alright, so here are some things you might want to know before you buy:* The gain knob when turned to zero still produces overdrive. So you can't use this as a *clean* boost pedal. With high output humbuckers, you still get some mild tube-like overdrive at zero gain. But this isn't advertised as a clean boost pedal.* So how much gain / distortion does this pedal have if you're going into a clean channel of an amp?  Plenty for classic rock and blues. Not enough for metal, though if you crank the gain and high knob all the way you can just barely get a prog style metal tone. But it's not a distortion pedal, it's just an overdrive.* This thing uses tiny SMC components in the circuitry and therefore isn't really moddable.* Unlike the Bad Monkey, this doesn't have an additional mixer / cabinet emulated output.* Like a tube screamer, it boosts the mids and reduces the bass so that going into a mushy sounding tube channel you get a tighter distorted sound. Anyone who has a nice warm amp and gets this pedal thinking they'll get more of the same, may be disappointed. What they need instead is a transparent clean boost pedal that keeps their guitar the same tone just louder volume.* The classic/modified switch is pretty cool. I have two guitars, one is kind of bassy and scooped sounding, the other is bright and middy. Well, using the switch, I can make one come out more equivalent to the other when needed. This keeps me from adjusting my amp each time I switch guitars. Classic is a slightly lower gain, more mid-boosted sound. Quite tight. Think Peavey 6505 EQ structure. Modified is more scooped, saturated. Think Mesa EQ structure. So this switch is a useful little bonus.*  It eats batteries, sucking in around 150 mA at 9V, so my 300 mAH rechargeable lasts 1.5-2 hrs. I swear if that blue LED weren't so bright it would probably get an extra hour. Instead of getting an adapter, I got an 8-battery AA clip, 9V battery clip, 12V DC plug, and 8 Sanyo Eneloop batteries. Hooked it up with negative tip, positive sleeve and now I have a 16,000 mAH monster = about 100 hours play time.This pedal is perfect. You get what it's advertised to do. It's rugged, looks good.

Someone mentioned the silver tops of the dials falling off as if they were decals, but I looked and the knobs seem like all one solid piece to me.Another thing I found is that instead of using an overdrive plugin in my DAW, if I use this real overdrive pedal in front of my interface, that magically makes all hum / noise from my pickups go away.Overall, yes I highly recommend this, and would suggest people check out the Hardwire Metal Distortion if they want something as a standalone rather than an overdrive into a crunchy amp.

It's portable and runs on 4AA batteries.2. It has compression, exciter & de-esser as well as EQ and Reverb.3. It has a mastering section with effects.4. You can record 8 tracks and then bounce them to free up more tracks.5. It feels sturdy (not that I would drop it)....just to name a few.  I compared this against the Fostex MR8mkII, which I also own and like. The Tascam has more features for the buck, as well it should as it just came out this year and the Fostex has been around a while. As another reviewer put it, this won't replace your DAW. I can record some very polished songs on my laptop, but the Tascam does come close. The mics in the front are a great feature and sound pretty good too. I have recorded a few songs on this already and found it to be a very enjoyable experience. The portability factor is huge in my opinion. Being able to take it downstairs when the kids are upstairs, or vice versa, is great.

After the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. Next, I proceeded to adjust the intonation. I was able to get the intonation for the A, D, G, B, and high-E strings spot on. However, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted E note on the 12th fret was still sharp.I also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-E string intonation.I love the Red Burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED).

I think this is a good guitar and when you think that something that might sound better would cost three to four times as much it is a great guitar for the value.This model has the cedar top.  I love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars.  It is a bit more mellow and has a hint of a classical guitar tone because of that.  If you prefer the bright concert sound of a Martin then you'll not want this cedar top.Yes this guitar has an oiled finish.  This allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded.  It also allows you to knock the heck out of it.  Funny thing is that after five years there isn't much damage just a little arm wear.  I think you'll like this guitar enough to not knock it around.The neck feels silky smooth.  The frets are well placed and don't stab you by hanging over the neck a little which is what you'll get in other guitars in this price range.  Paying to get the frets filed down is an additional expense on those competitors so beware when comparing.This doesn't come with a case so I bought a hard shell by the brand name ""Canadian"".  Great case.When I bought it it really didn't need an adjustment but I took it to a local shop to make it perfect for me.  I've also taken it in every other year for setting the action - checking and tweaking the neck - and getting the frets polished.  I also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in Chicago.

I went to a handful of guitar stores looking for another acoustic ""just for fun"" and I had a few bucks burning a hole in my pocket.  To my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior.  You see I learned that as you play a good wood guitar that over time it will ""open up"" and keep sounding better.

What I can't tell you is how well they actually meet humidity ideals because I've never monitored the humidity in the case to see what it is and if it is on par with what the manufacturer says. I have taken it pretty much on faith that they deliver what they say and they have read some endorsements by people like Bob Taylor of Taylor guitars that they work. Bob has too good a name and no incentive that I know of to be frivolous about endorsing such a product that might not work, so, I take it that Taylor had his lab people check them out thoroughly to be sure of Humidipaks effectiveness before Mr. Taylor would give them an endorsement. That was good enough to sell me. But I didn't just buy it because Bob Taylor says they work--they occupy a very cool niche which I was hping someone would fill. Planet Waves Humidipaks are for the person who is willing to spend a little extra to not to have to keep fiddling around with water, sponges, gauges and those Oasis water bag and just have something that you can dispose of and replace every so often. That's what I want. Sure, water is free. But it evaporates fast and it's a job to keep having to take care of. So, is it worth it to buy a disposable thing like this that you don't have to mess with? Or do you want to save $15 or so by doing all that work wetting sponges and whatnot weekly? I'll gladly pay the extra few bucks not to have to worry about hydrating my guitars and cases but once avery 6 months.None of my guitars have shown any signs of humidity issues and I have lived in New York City and Virginia Beach in the years since I've been using the Planet Waves Humidipaks. One accolade that I will give Planet Waves is that they did recall the product a few years back and promised replacements when the new model which resolved a potential leakage problem was released. That re-release seemed to drag on for a while and when I contacted Planet Waves to gripe, they sent me a check for the ""list"" price of all the units I had returned to them. Well the list price was three times the retail price at the time and that was a bit of a minor windfall at the time for me which impressed the heck out of me and I used the money to buy their other humidity products in the interim to humidify my guitars. But when the Humidipaks were available again they sent me replacements ANYWAY. That was really being treated well by Planet Waves and I have never used anything else but Humidipaks since.

Oh how life changes with a baby! :)This little product is the perfect solution.It takes two AAA batteries (some generic brand are included in the package). There are two ON settings: regular ON and ""FX"" ON. Regular on is basically like a standard lead channel. Turn down the gain and the cleans are pretty clean. Crank up the gain and you get a nice rock crunch. Nothing heavy metal, but a nice crisp crunch. FX ON turns on a little delay effect. You can not adjust the delay effect, only turn it on or off. There are also knobs for volume and tone.Plug your headphones into the side, and you can also plug in an MP3 player on the top to jam with a backing track.VOX has samples for all of their AMPlugs on their website, however they seem to be missing samples for the Joe Satriani version.

I am keeping it and it is probably going to become a permanant addition to my pedalboard. Only time will tell but I like adding some vibrato for clean sounds. It reminds me a lot of how I used to set up my Super Reverb amp. Compared to all pedals, I'd actually give it 4 stars - downgrading 1 star for the plastic case and the limited functionality of the Rise control. But I liked it so much I decided to score it ""at its price point"".PROS- dirt cheap at $25 for a new pedal- sounds great - does not add or subtract any frequencies or add any noise (I wish I could say the same for some $200 pedals I've tried.)- Latched/Unlatched mode -- the best feature on the pedal. I love that I can put this in unlatched mode and use it to vibrato in short bursts.- Small form factor - normal ""single pedal"" size- Standard power supply - 9V Center negative - runs from pedal board power or a battery- The larger foot pedal surface (compared to just a silver bullet switch) is nice for the unlatched mode useCONS- Cheap plastic case - I doubt its durability and would have preferred to pay more for a more durable case.- Latched/unlatched switch is small (hard to reach, have to bend over, can't do with a toe)- Rise control has only the most subtle impact on sound. Probably not needed on this pedal. Two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability.- Like most pedals - the knobs are super small and not easily controlled with a toe, and the settings are hard to see. My favorite pedals have large knobs, well marked settings you can see from a distance, enough space between the knobs to set one without bumping another, and in the best cases, enough space, size, and durability for the knobs to be tweakable by a foot or toe bump.Suggested Redesign, ""Super Vibrato"" or ""Vibrato II""1) Change to a metal case2) Lose the Rise control altogether3) put the latched/unlatched modes on a 2nd stomp switch so you can stomp to go between modes4) Increase the size of and space between the other two controls -- put large ""foot controllable"" knobs with high visibility knobs.Then again, at 25 bucks, I might just buy a 2nd one and put one in latched and one in unlatched mode.",5.0,A keeper - I really like it,1377043200,"08 21, 2013"

I've played with straps in the past and always found them to be uncomfortable, so I hoped to find a padded strap that didn't break the bank.  This strap fits the bill just fine.  Depending on the angle that your pegs are set, however, you may find that the holes in the strap will with time enlarge to the point that the guitar is always in danger of falling.  If your pegs are set at an angle, like on a Strat, this strap will last forever.  If you're on a guitar with a horizontal peg, like a LP, you'll probably want to invest in some strap locks as well.  This will move the pressure from the strap holes to the metal locks and both extend the lifetime of the strap and its security.  The padding is OK, but not great - however, it's certainly better than a regular nylon strap and does a good job of forcing the strap to lay flat across the shoulder which is a huge bonus.",4.0,A decent enough strap for the money...,1392854400,"02 20, 2014"

A23NSKTMSPPBTR,B002VA464S,Wayne,"[1, 1]","This is a good quality microphone. The sound quality is good in the various modes, although I have used it primarily in cardioid and stereo modes. It's easy to set up. Under Windows 7, all I had to do is plug it in. The instruction manual hasn't been updated in years and gives instructions for Windows Vista and XP. The instructions for Vista are mostly accurate for Windows 7, but I found that the default settings are better than the recommended settings in the instructions. Also there is no driver supplied by the company. The Microsoft driver will work fine, and there might not be a sonic advantage to making their own driver. But it means that there is no custom control panel and you have to use the more obscure Windows ones. Also the icon for the microphone doesn't match the product, which isn't really a big deal. It's just a matter of attention to detail. The instruction manual is in English and French, but the warranty information is in French in both places. They both say there is a two year warranty and give a phone number in the Los Angeles area. There's a copy of the actual warranty on their website, although it does have terms that violate US law so I have no idea how they handle actual warranty issues.The only real negative I experienced when setting up was that it interfered with my keyboard. I'm using a fairly standard Logitech wireless keyboard, and it experienced a lag, and not all letters showed up when I typed. I unplugged the USB cable for the microphone and things went back to normal. Repeating the process yielded identical results. After rebooting the computer, the problem went away. Hopefully there won't be long term issues.The bottom line is that not a single problem related to the quality of the microphone itself, which works well, is very clear, and is extremely sensitive. It will pick up a whisper from 15 feet away with the same clarity as if I were sitting two feet in front of it. That's with volume settings that work clearly when I really am two feet in front of it.

And you absolutely  have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground.The best thing these stands are built for are V Type guitars such as my Jackson Rhoads as long as you can put them back to back. For Les Paul and Strat type axes, their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow, stick like feet of the stand, especially when they are new. You can't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible. So this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand.

A27L5L6I7OSV5B,B005FKF1PY,Otto Correct,"[4, 5]","I'll be upfront and honest right away and say that I'm not the biggest fan of headstock tuners.  I love the idea, but usually I feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired.  But when this popped up on my Vine newsletter I thought I'd give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things I don't like about the other ones (*COUGH*snark*COUGH*).A little background first, I guess.  I've been playing guitar for the last 9 years, and I currently have two other tuners.  I have a little Korg plug in type,  where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up.  I also have a Boss TU-3 pedal tuner.  If I'm jamming with friends or playing a show, the TU-3 is what I'll use to stay in tune.  Its very durable and accurate, and I like how I can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal, so I can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and/or the audience.  For home practice I use the Korg, as I usually tune up before I start playing, then just plug into my practice amp and blast away.  The Korg is nice and accurate, easy enough to use for alternate tunings, and in 9 years of having it around (including in and out of jam sessions before buying the TU-3) I've only had to buy one replacement.I first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue Snark that everyone seems to have these days.  He was not incredibly pleased with it.  Not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock, it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasn't exatly easy to tune up with it.  While I thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool, it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something I'd want on my headstock.Enter this Mini Headstock Tuner by Planet Waves.  Does it fix the problems that made the Snark so unappealing to my friend and me?1.  Accuracy:  It does seem to tune accurately, that's a good thing, and it already puts this ahead of the Snark.  Its not easy to use for alternate tunings however, so do keep that in mind.  Also, the letters take some getting used to, as they use that kind of chunky LCD block style that you find on some DVD players.  Not a huge complaint, but it isn't as idiot proof as my Korg or TU-3.2.  Looks/Ease Of Use:  It's quite a bit more subtle than the Snark, able to hide behind your headstock, which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar.  The only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a Les Paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side, you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen.  My LP copy has the larger Grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock.  I wear my guitar fairly low, so I was able find an area where I can see it from the top down, but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck.  Those with Fender style headstocks should have no problem, though, it'll work great for them.  Also, it is plenty bright, so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue.3.  Durability:  This is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are.  The Snark is very easy to break, as it rests on a small ball joint.  This Planet Waves mini isn't going to lose its head too easy, but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to hold up under too much use.  The tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too, so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session, I still think it would be easy enough to break.  I haven't had it long enough for this to happen yet, so I can only give you my initial impressions.  Let's just say this, I'd never gig with this guy as my only tuner.  Its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use.All in all, it is a better headstock choice than the Snark.  However, headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they're gonna work for everyone.  Anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner (I personally suggest a Boss TU-2 or TU-3 or a Korg Pitchblack).  I know they're more expensive, but you'll be happier off in the long run.  Those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session, this is a nice option.  But it may not hold up forever.I'll probably stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug in, but as headstock tuners go, this is nicer than most.",3.0,"Its good for what it is, but they're not great yet...",1319587200,"10 26, 2011"
A27L5L6I7OSV5B,B00AQBT3EW,Otto Correct,"[4, 6]","Strung these up on my LP Goldtop with P-90's.D'Addario promises these strings to be ""comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations"" that result in ""greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings.""I dunno anything regarding the science behind this, but the main difference in gauge seems to be slightly thicker A and D strings compared to the regular set of D'Addario 10s they offer.  Its not a huge huge difference, but the strings are fairly unique in their feel and performance.For one thing, they're pretty stiff.  They bend, but not easily.  Maybe that's what they mean by ""Balanced tension.""  They're also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated 10s.  Not flatwound mellow, by any means, but not quite as bright as your regular set of 10s.  I do get a great rock tone out of them, mind you, but you may be taken aback at first by their slightly darker sound.  Personally, I like the tone I get out of them, they're big and warm without being dull sounding, but again, your preferences might differ.One thing that's GREAT about these strings is, once they're properly stretched, they stay in tune FOREVER!  Again, maybe this is part of the ""balanced tension,"" and if so, good job D'Addario.I haven't had them on forever to really see how long they last, but they've been on for two weeks and sound just as good as day one.Who would these appeal to?  Well, if you like really light strings that bend easily, you're not going to like these.

A27V6PS7Y83OIV,B0040O49OU,Mathew K Raikes,"[14, 15]","I ordered this strap to use with both my concert & tenor ukes.  It just works.I already owned a ukulele leash-type thing that required me to poke my arm through a loop at one end and then put a hook in the uke's sound hole or tie it off to the head. The problem, of course is that if you just let go of the uke it still falls away from your body (sometimes disastrously).  With a strap like this one, you can completely let go of your uke & it stays perfectly in place. Chord changes & strumming become easier when you don't have to concentrate so much on clamping the thing to your body or supporting the neck.This is a nice size strap, not to wide not to narrow.  The length is easily adjusted to work with a variety of uke (and uke player) sizes. It does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke. The other end of the strap can be tied to the head with the included string if you like to do it that way. In my case I installed two buttons - more convenient and the strap doesn't interfere with my chord-hand. Here are the buttons I used:Strap ButtonsIf the thought of installing buttons makes you hesitant, put your fears aside. It can be done quickly & easily and the end result is well worth it.

Koretsky ""DIYer""","[1, 1]","I bought this product for only one reason: I have several amps that are not guitar amps, but stereo or PA-type, clean, high powered , two channels, that I want to use as guitar amps, either as the primary or backup. This tube modeler acts first as a pre-amp, and then adds gain, volume control, ""crunch"", whatever, to the non-guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps. I don't really care what tube amps it models, or what mic placement, I just want the guitar amp sound and style. I also use it in front of a Behringer Ultra-G DI box, so that the DI box splits the signal coming from the TM300 and sends half to my non-guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage, and the other half to the house PA. I don't think that many people would do this.The sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp, and kind of amp you are driving with it, and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving. The acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound, but I've used this box with all of its settings driving PA amps, home stereo amps, bass amps, and guitar amps, all of which drove PA speakers, bass speakers and Eminence Commonwealth 12 guitar speakers, all in the same acoustic space. Each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant, sound different: some more like guitar  amps and speakers, some not. As I said, I don't really care about what tube amp is being modeled, only that I get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box. It works for me.I read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog Sansamp GT2, and based on its performance so far, it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the Sansamp can do.

As for the rest, I'll take line 6's real drums sets and myriad of song backings over the Fender's midi/synthe tunes any day. The ability to save your custom tunes as JAM or WAV files internally or out to a larger SD card is a godsend and to me, the single biggest factor to own this amp over a G-Dec.

The XLR mike, 1/4"" plug aux & MP3 inputs allow a great flexibility for total song creation. Coupled with my Line 6 Variax guitar, I have been able to produce an amazing range of sounds and songs.The only criticisms I can muster are: 1) - The menu process is more difficult than the G-Dec but easy enough with hands-on experience. 2) - The chrome plastic knobs look somewhat cheap but work well enough. 3) - Line six really needs to update to an SDHC format so it can utilize larger than 2gb SD storage cards. I have experimented with using a 4GB non-HC SD card & though I was able to format it, I was not able to read / write to it. Line 6, please go to SDHC!

After working at it a few minutes, I got it to fit, and it wore really nicely once I got the length where I wanted. Taking it on/off the guitar isn't too much trouble, but over the past few months the bottom slit has stretched a little more - enough to make it easier to get it on.

However this is made up for when you step on your overdriveor distortion. Solos just sing on this amp.  I feel like my guitar pickups and stomp boxes sound better. The ampcompliments your rig in some mysterious way.  I stopped using my combo amp all together because the sounds so good. I also kinda detect some what of a processed chorusy sound plugged straight in when I first turn it on (seems to go away). I know it is an analog path but has some digital modeling processing internally. It also seems to have a positive compression/pumping release that make the notes sing and get louder as they ring.Volume?  For a conservative band in a small room it fits the bill. Mic'ing for larger venues would work just fine.If you're in a LOUD band, you might consider plugging in an external cabinet as it does have that option. (darn I meant to test before this review). TIP- so on youtube and some other forums guys are making the amp louder by plugging a blank cord into the1/8"" aux input on the back. I tested this and yes, it does go louder for whatever the reason. (I'll be getting a blank 1/8""jack to put it that aux port) A small but very noticeable volume increase. If you need to be LOUDER then I suggest the larger ZT, but its double the price. A friend of mine has one and he no longer uses his mesa boogie or marshall amps anymore. The 12 club ZT is super loud.I can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesn't get all noisy or feedback.1-100 I rate this a 98% gear head satisfaction. Remember we are talking about a lunchbox with a 6.5"" speakera tremendous feat of technology to get that much sound out of a little box.Check it out the reviews on youtube.PART II -Ok, the extension cabinet option: Hooked up a 8 ohm cab and it sounded bigger and louder. However do NOT use the internal speaker together with the extension cabinet - Turn the switch off. It WILL overheat the amp and start acting weird. I found out the hard way, verified with the manual that you should shut off the internal speaker. I would assume that at a low volume you could conceivably use both.

I am the only guitarist and in my playing environment (children's church) and frequently need to switch back and forth between acoustic and electric. The AC3 does that job. Although it has several modes, the Jumbo mode seems to be most useful. Played through a carefully EQ'd amp, you can get a tone comparable to a plugged in acoustic electric with very bright settings. There is an audible hiss, less noticeable plugged direct into PA, noticeable plugged into a good, clean tube amp, out of control with humbuckers or solid states.The key to using this pedal is using it correctly.First and foremost: use single coils. Tested with a Les Paul with Burstbucker Pro's, the hiss was overwhelming. Played with an American Deluxe Strat with N3 Noiseless pups in the 3rd position, it actually performed very well on a crystal clean channel.Point two - any form of gain will create a ton of hiss.Point three - tube amps perform infinitely better than solid state amps (tested through a Frontman 212 and Vox Pathfinder vs an Orange Tiny Terror and Fender HRD).The AC3 is not a set it and forget it pedal. Based on the volume of the amp and the room you're in, you will need to tweek the EQ to find that tone. I've read that you can use an EQ pedal to get the same tones, I haven't found that to be the case. If your use for this pedal is to cover acoustic parts in a pinch, or in my case as the only guitar player, to switch from acoustic to electric parts quickly, this is a great fit.-2 stars for ever present  hiss, +3 for actually sounding like an acoustic when it's EQ'd correctly.",3.0,Serves it's purpose,1376179200,"08 11, 2013"

I came well packed and looked much better in person than the pics on the website. It was set-up very well, among the few guitars I have purchased that were playable out of the box. Fret work is top notch. Finish is good, some very slight blems but if you play it like you should you'll add some of your own. There was a slight binding in the nut, most people think it's the tuners right away but most tuning problems are at the nut. A quick fix with some pencil lead or chap stick will fix it up. If you can't make your own nut adjustments visit your favorite guitar tech. When you hear the pinging sound when tuning you have a nut issue. The only thing I did was lower the bridge a bit and this thing plays like a dream. Plugged in it sounds good, you can get a lot of different sounds with the simple use of the volume and tone. Picking closer to the neck or bridge varies your sound. Play close to the bridge with tone wide open puts you in Tele territory while using the volume to clean things up or add some dirt to the sound. Add some tone knob and pick closer to the neck to get into the blues region. This guitar will make you a more versatile player. The absence of a neck pickup reduces the magnetic pull on the strings and lets them ring out. Sustain is very good as a result. I could carry on forever but you get the idea. I've been a player for 45 years and a collector for half of that. I own many vintage guitars including Gibson, Fender, Gretsch.

Also, I have the otherPlanet Waves Chromatic Headstock Tunerto compare this one to.  Here are the pros and cons of this tuner as I see them:Pros:- Super compact.  Virtually invisible from the front of the guitar.- Adjustable frequency settings.- Top load battery.  No need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh battery.Cons:- Awkward in use when not used on a inline six tuning peg headstock.  I have a Gibson Les Paul and this tuner is awkward to use with it.- Less gradation in setting than other tuners.  The gradiation bars are thicker and fewer in number, giving less of a sense of how close you are to a perfect tuning.Debatable:- Clip mechanism: Not spring loaded.  This means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar.- One battery: This unit takes only one battery versus two with the other.When it boils down to it, I prefer my old planet waves tuner.  It seems more accurate to me with the finer gradations (though both units gave roughly the same results when tuning - using both at the same time) and I like the ability to clip it on and off in a hurry.  In fact I can easily recommend that tuner, main drawback is that that one eats batteries)This tuner is more catered to Fender-style headstocks for players that plan on leaving the tuner clipped on.

In fact, even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifier.I love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand. It is essentially three parts: the base and two removable arms. Granted that this is heavy, but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tank.In addition to being rock solid, the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances. The support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement, and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions. You merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position. Once you line up the holes, release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in place.My only complaint - and it is more of a wish - is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle. I would love it if I could adjust that too, but I am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand. One final note: these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage. Specifically, it increases the depth dimension by nearly 100% of my Frontman 212R, although the difference in length is nominal.

It is powered via the USB bus, so you don't have to carry power supplies, or worry about finding an outlet for the device.One issue is that this is not a plug-and-play device.  You will need to install a device driver in order for your computer to recognize it.  After the driver was installed, I was able to get Pro Tools to recognize it right away without any issue.  I recorded some tracks just to see how easy it was to work with and how it sounded.  It works like any other interface in Pro Tools, so you will be able to use it easily enough.  The mic pre-amps don't seem terribly powerful and you will have to really up the input level to get anything out of a 48v condenser microphone like the ones I use to record vocals and guitars.  I found that the overall sound quality was okay, but just okay. I wouldn't want to use this for anything important, but it will work fine if you are doing a field recording of rehearsals, or doing pre-production in a practice space.  I wouldn't recommend it for serious studio work though and I would rather drag my Pro Tools I/O rack to a location if I was in the field.The build quality is a bit suspect on this as well.  I noticed that the unit made a clinking noise when I picked it up after taking it out of the box.  It seems that the bottom panel is not secure and is a bit loose.  I can move the top and bottom together and apart, making a clinking sound.  This can, of course, be taken care of very easily, but I would rather have a device come as it should.  I have never had a problem with a TASCAM unit before and I have had a ton over the years, so I hope this is just a one-off quality control issue.

A2Y8JW5NSY95OL,B005FKF3L6,JdoubleH,"[10, 10]","I must first state for the record, I hate strap locks. Hate may be a bit shy of the mark, actually. I've never met a set I liked in any single way.  I've only ever dropped an instrument that HAD strap locks on it. In fact, EVERY instrument I've owned with strap locks has suffered a gravity attack caused by the very device intended to prevent such misfortune. Schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed- even with Locktite. When you install them, you are compressing the nut and washer against a compressible material (leather, nylon, etc), so it is never really tight. Plus there's only about two threads on the slim little nut, and if they aren't a really tight match to the other half, wear very quickly (especially since you have to tighten them so often). Duncan type often suffer from 'non-positive lock syndrome' if not regularly cleaned and lubed. Then there's the fact that unless all of your instruments are equipped with the same brand of lock buttons, your strap is only compatible with the ones which match. And then there is the the metal-on-metal clankyness. Yuck. Oh, and and the cost. Moving on.Why are these little Elliptical End Pins so brilliant? They are NOT strap locks. If you orient the widest points horizontally when you install them - as you should, then in order to put your strap on and take it off, you will need to turn the strap 90 degrees to the instrument. This isn't something you are likely to do inadvertently while reaching for your beer onstage. Sometimes the simplest design is the best design. And they're pretty, too.Downsides? I will say the screws supplied with these are pretty short, but then I would also argue there is no reason to not use the screws holding in the original strap buttons as long as they fit tightly. If they don't, using smaller or shorter screws is not the answer- especially considering if the screws cut new threads, you're pretty much- uh, screwed. The washers these come with are pretty small too, so I just used the screws and felt washers that came with the factory buttons. With a brand new strap, they can be a bit tricky to get on, but just as tricky to get off (which is good). That tight fit could cause some increased wear on the strap, especially if it is made from cheap materials. With older straps, just as with any traditional strap button, you need to develop a good habit of always checking the positive seat of the strap, but it is very easy to verify, and again much less likely to slip than a traditional button. Mechanical strap locks actually require just as much diligence to ensure they are still securely fastened and working properly. But with strap locks, if there's a problem, you'll have to grab some tools to fix it - or replace it entirely. Talk about a false sense of security. With PE's Elliptical End Pins, you just put the strap where it should be and you're set.If you are one who is taken to doing back-flips, or find yourself frequently using your strapped instrument like a hula-hoop onstage, then these probably won't save your precious instrument from the gravity goblin or inertia monkey's worst intentions. But if either of these antics are your norm, you might be better served by a permanently attached strap, or perhaps therapy.Since writing the review above, I've ordered several more sets to use on all of my basses. I'm done with traditional strap buttons and don't imagine ever going back to metal on metal strap locks.",5.0,"Excellent design, simple solution for those who hate strap locks",1356307200,"12 24, 2012"

The first thing that I did when I brought it home was to make a different single patch for each effect. The big question is &#34;Why?&#34; especially since it's designed to handle up to 6 effects simultaneously. The answer is... I like my overdrive, distortion, and compressor, but I couldn't make up my mind on delays, choruses, flangers, fuzz... and it's always nice to have options for additional over drives and distortions.This is the 4th pedal on my board sitting behind a ModTone Lemon Squeeze Compressor, TC Electronics MOJOMOJO overdrive, and a Wampler Sovereign distortion.I give it 5 stars because it accepts pedals well and it serves so many different needs.

When I got the stand and opened it for the first time and tried to put my Fender Jazz bass on it - lol - no way.  Worthless, and it's now holding my son's 3/4 size classical guitar (barely).Undaunted, I ordered this Musician's Gear stand.

I'd characterize this box as a cross between distortion and fuzz, maintaining enough definition for chord work.  If you're reading the reviews, you've probably already done your research on the features, but I'll cover them anyway.Three simple controls, Volume - Tone - Sustain, with the Sustain control being more or less a Gain control.  The enclosure is a smaller, pedalboard-friendly size.  The pedal incorporates two of the (supposedly) most popular Big Muff mods with switches, Tone and Wicker.  When Tone is switched off, the Tone control and its tone-shaping circuitry are completely disconnected.  In this mode, the distortion applies to the entire tonal spectrum evenly, and it also produces a significant volume boost.  The Tone knob does nothing.When Wicker is switched on, it removes three high-frequency rolloff filters that were added to the original Big Muff circuit to smooth out the sound.  Disconnecting these makes the sound a bit raspier and rougher, with a high-end frequency boost.I use this pedal running into a mild overdrive, the Catalinbread Dirty Little Secret, which ""conditions"" the signal.  I play with the Tone off and Wicker on, and even with the Volume and Sustain controls set fairly low, this combination results in a wonderfully thick, massive distorted tone that is still pretty smooth.If you're looking to get a Big Muff, and you're not a snob about which version, the switchable mods on this one are really great for experimenting to find your own sound.  Not to mention that, at this price point, it will be much cheaper than some vintage Muffs.  Highly recommended.",5.0,Great choice for a versatile big muff.,1284854400,"09 19, 2010"

They are a wonderful innovation and certainly easier to use than the older rectangular chromatic tuners that do not attach to the instrument. One of my favorites has become the Planet Waves clip on. I have several of them and use them often on many guitars. Based on this experience, I was anticipating a better experience with this new Mini Headstock Tuner than I wound up getting.It tunes nicely and, so far as my ear is concerned, accurately. Others found it awkward to attach - I did not. It is small and unobtrusive but easy to read. Those are not problems. What is wrong is simply the cheap and fragile the construction of the device.This fragility is conspicuous in both the difficulty in removing the battery cover and, more importantly, in the too-delicate manual clamp used to fasten it onto an instrument.The fundamental issue is that in lieu of the spring clips that we used to attach other versions of the Planet Waves tuners to the guitars, this one has a basic manual expand and contract clamp. This clamp is made out of thin plastic, is difficult to adjust and I expect it to break after only a short time. Consequently, I cannot recommend this tuner if the user needs to be moving it from one instrument to the other.If the need is for a tuner that attaches to ONE instrument and will, essentially, live there, it is nice little tuner which remains functionally invisible to all but the player. If you need to move the tuner from instrument to instrument, you would be well advised to spend a few more dollars and stick with the clip-on versions of Planet Waves tuners.November 28,2011 UPDATEHaving used this tuner for a while now, I have found that it has a good purpose. While this tuned does have mobility issues as I initially noted, I have been surprised (and pleased)to realize that they are wonderful 'permanent' tuners for acoustic guitars! They are so small as to be unobtrusive and nearly invisible. I leave them on my 12-strings and one of the 6's. A non-built-in-built-in tuner at this price cannot be beat.

I spent over 8 years in professional radio and 30 plus years doing voice over recording and sound mixing, so I have heard and used all types of mics and I have to rate the Blue Yeti at the top of my list for many reasons. First is sound quality, all the patterns have a smooth, open sound, the cardioid pattern has added richness for voice over work, comparable dare I say to a Sennheiser or Sure. The sound in all the patterns was not colored or muted at any frequency level, which what is I was expecting in the stereo mode, but in that pattern, voices sound great and an acoustic guitar sounded rich, plucky and natural. Next is the construction of the mic and stand, from the pictures I was expecting plastic, nope, it is made of very solid metal , except the buttons and switches. Third is the versatility, you can record almost anything in any type of circumstance not just adequately, but with excellence, try that with a $2,000.00 Neumann! The set up could not be easier, just plug it into your USB jack and let her rip. I only paid $100.00 on Amazon,a true bargain, for what is a top notch piece of gear, where the engineers of this product really took their time to design something of real quality and looks like a piece of art. The Yeti also stands up to audio processing, where I have to say all of the other mics I have used for under $200.00 show their weaknesses. The only thing I would like to see is a shock mount made for this mic, it is just too big for all of my other mounts, but the Yeti does not seem to pick up as much vibration from the table as other mics do (I also use a slab of 1/4"" neoprene padding to absorb some table shock), and the Yeti has no real audible self noise. If you want a great microphone at an incredible price, the Blue Yeti is the one for you!Addendum 9-30-2011My complaint about the shock mount has been resolved, with the Blue Radius, which I received a week ago from Amazon, which I love. Makes this great, and I mean great microphone even better. I have done side by side comparisons to the Neumann U87, the Sennhieser D421, the Lawson L47, all top notch and very expensive studio mics. The Yeti sounds as good. Of course you have to learn how to work a microphone properly to get the right sound. I cringe at some YouTube demos of this mic, some of the folks are not using this, and I'm sure other mike's correctly to get the best sound.

I was actually in the market for an electric violin and while shopping Amazon ran across this inexpensive pickup for an acoustic. I purchased it at the same time I bought the electric violin. Naturally when the electric arrived, I laid the acoustic pick up off to the side and went to work on the electric. A few days later I thought I would give the pickup a try. It slides right in and out of an F hole with no problem. I plugged it into my Fender amp with a little reverb and WOW is how I can describe what came out. It sounded like I was in a Great Concert Hall. Of course there is no adjustments on the pickup so everything is done with the settings on the amp. Whatever your amp is capable of, your violin can do it. Now I haven't tried to blow it up or anything but the sound is tremendous.

It was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews.  I found it to be excellent for the price and so far, have had no problems with the zippers.This product is described as a ""Soprano Ukulele Gig Bag"" and that is exactly what it is.  A ""gig bag"" is *not* a rigid FAA-approved flight case, nor is it a semi-rigid polystyrene ""case"" with soft covering.  Reviewers that don't believe this is sufficiently padded are looking for something other than a ""gig bag"" and don't understand the term.  You wouldn't put your reading glasses in a soft, padded case and expect to be able to sit on them would you?I don't know if some other reviewers tried to fit concert-sized ukuleles or other larger sizes into this bag, but I found that it fits the soprano size perfectly.  It is *very well padded* for a gig bag, having extra padding at the base of the instrument (where the bottom strap button would be if you have one) to cushion the bottom if you hold it standing on end.  It also has a nicely padded handle.  I received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well.  (Ukulele not included.

A33LV2M1PAJZ45,B002GHBZ4U,James Tunnicliffe,"[0, 0]","I should start by saying that I did not buy this from Amazon. Not that it's a bad price, but I got a discount on an open box demo unit at a local Guitar Center for $179.00. I've seen them cheaper for used ones, but I wanted a new one with a warranty.I am using this amp for an electric violin and for an acoustic violin with a pickup. I wanted the cleanest sound, with bare bones controls and that's what this little champ provides. Most of the time, I use it with the Gain on 1 or 2 and the Volume past 5.It's very cool that it has 5w, 1w, and .1w settings. I haven't seen that in any amp in this price range. The 1w setting is perfect for my studio, and the .1w setting is great for using with the headphones jack. The 5w setting can really crank out the volume.You could spend about $100 more and get a Vox AC4 series all tube amp. That's another amp I was considering. I wanted something not too big and portable, but could use at home without shredding the walls. But the Vox doesn't even have Reverb like the Bugera which has only a single pre-amp tube. And the Vox is 4w, while the Bugera boasts 5w.I know if I plugged an electric guitar in and cranked the gain I could get some lovely distortion, because I've tried that with the violin. The digital reverb has a spacious feel. I love reverb and wouldn't buy an amp without it.It seems to be built well and only time will tell if it holds up under daily use, which I plan to do. When it comes time to change the tube, there are many choices for a nice upgrade to something better than the stock Bugera tube. I've even read online where people drop in a different speaker, but in my opinion the Bugera 8"" speaker is just fine and sounds like a bigger one.All in all, I'm very pleased. I also tried the Bugera V22 all tube amp at the same Guitar Center. But, that's way too much amp for me at this time. If I were to fill a large hall with sound, that would be the way to go. The V22 is sweet. I had never heard of Bugera until I tried that model and was really impressed. Another option is to unplug the speaker in the V5, (yes, the speaker has a plug and a jack!) and drive another speaker cabinet, which Bugera also makes. You can use any speaker cabinet, I guess, that has a minimum of 4 OHMS, which is clearly written near the jack.The Bugera V5 is perfect for me, and I wouldn't go down to the smaller Bugera BC15. I think Bugera has hit the nail on the head with quality and value, and I'll be looking into other products made by Bugera/Behringer/Music Group.

I am using a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus unit, and had some minor issues getting the plug-ins to line up with the cutouts on the board itself. As the other user here mentions, the cutouts on the board are slightly too close together. You can center the Voodoo in such a way to make sure both plugs are useable, but the overall install is not 100% in-line.I did not run into any connector issues mentioned by the other user review here, using the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus system. All connectors that came with the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus, fit perfectly, and there are no clearance issues. One quick PRO-TIP: Leave the Connector Brackets slightly loose when installing your Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus, as this will let you make fine adjustments, once the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus is dropped into the back of the Pedaltrain. Once this are lined up to your liking, or as close as possible, based on the narrow cutouts, then you can tighten your brackets screws all the way down, and then use a punch to mark your indented drill holes. There is a pretty decent video on Youtube by Pedaltrain, which will help with the process. My only small complaint is that they don't use a center punch.

The A/D is often weak, and there is sometimes too much latency for it to be useful for multi-tracking. Apogee covers both areas well with this little puppy; the A/D is quite smooth, and it transfers the signal near perfectly. And little it is, not much bigger than the jack. If Bon Scott only knew...But small though it may be, there's plenty of signal processing power in there, and while it doesn't stand up my best outboard gear, it offers very clean, clear sound transfers from guitar, bass, keys and line mics, so that you can do good-sounding entire tunes on your laptop with only the JAM as interface. Which is yet another step forward in high-quality home recordings. I like the thought that we're getting closer to folks releasing things entirely by themselves on their own sites, and not paying Crapple a huge chunk of profits for merely hosting a file. Record companies and file hosts are increasingly anachronistic due to tech like this JAM, and maybe soon enough we'll see artists keeping ALL of the profits from their art. Imagine that!This offers very close to studio quality, but keep in mind that even with 24-bit it is solid state. Once you've used a good tube preamp you know what a difference in warmth in can make. I ran this through one of mine and the A/B made it very obvious that old school studio gear still has its place.Speaking of Crapple, the ads for this suggest that it is for iStuff only, which is not true. I ran it on 7 Ultimate and it worked a charm, so don't be fooled by the typically proprietary ads, which Cook and co. probably insist on: &#34;Don't mention anybody but us! Offer no alternatives! They must stay in our universe!&#34; Well, you needn't, this works with almost anything, so don't be fooled by the ad copy.The only negative I can find is that it is a little chintzy in outer build, making one wonder how good the internals are, and how long they'll hold up.

Pretty much what I expected - much more ""relaxed"" at higher volumes than the M1.2. Definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks.- slightly less naturally sparkly compared to the M1- will have to reduce the mids a bit via the Fuse editor.- although it has less overall sparkle, that also translates to smoother highs. I was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy. This is of course via the front panel only. I'm sure it can be done using the Fuse editor.3. It's supposed to be 7 lbs. heavier than the M1 but it sure doesn't feel like it. I keep looking at the M1 fiendishly wondering if there's a way to shoehorn a 12"" speaker in there.4. For the most part, the patches created in the M1 translated pretty well after the required firmware update, needing just a few adjustments here and there.5. I'm appreciative of the fuller more naturally extended low end as I won't have to crank the bass control as much as I have to on the M1. That of course translates to more headroom for the power amp.More from editing via Fuse - here are a few of the things that I found and liked.- The 65 Deluxe model sounds better with the 57 Deluxe's Cab and vice versa. The 65 has more headroom and works great as a clean spanky amp with the 57's cab while the 57 model's propensity to break up sooner works better with the 65's less sparkly cab. The 57 also seems to have more low end girth.- The Twin is a bit too icepick-y sometimes and it seems to pair better with the Bassman's cab.- The SuperSonic's Cab is a bit more muted at the top end than any of the other cabs and works well for sounds I use that have a bit more gain. It's good for keeping things from getting too buzzy. It's a very fat sounding Cab sim.- Both the M1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my Tex-Mex pickups. I have not played a guitar with regular sized humbuckers on these amps yet (my other guitar has mini humbuckers) but somehow I get the feeling that I won't like it as much as I do with the strat.

My PC is for general-use with a non-studio configuration (no mixer, non-phantom power mics, headphone monitoring).If you're buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs, you'll need a separate mixer and/or standalone phantom supply. From the mixer you can cable to the US-100's line input via RCA jacks on the back.There were a couple of hiccups during setup, but I don't blame the device. It uses stock O/S drivers that loaded right up. The documentation is minimal and only covers up to Vista, but it's accurate and you'll manage with Win7. On the Windows side make the USB AudioCodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or card-based audio and speakers (I have Realtek onboard and 2.1 desktop speakers).I'm using ASIO4ALL with Cubase and Cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring VST connections and I/O busses. Once configured however, it's been solid.I'd recommend checking out user forums for your particular software/platform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectations.On an XP machine, changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the DAW. On Win7, once I unplug the US-100, the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers. If I plug the US-100 back in, the settings revert again - very reliable. Even better, if I want to use Cubase strictly for MIDI, the software detects the change and I don't have to reconfigure connections or busses. That may be a function of Cubase, so again it pays to research your particular software.While the US-100 is connected, you'll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the US-100's headphone jack or audio out RCA jacks. This is where the balance control is very helpful. It's not a pan, it's a center position gain mixing the computer's output (from within your DAW as well as outside system sounds) with direct monitoring of your input signal. Very simple to use for overdubbing. Some people may prefer a hard left/right pan while overdubbing: I can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific feature.If you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done, there are a number ways to go: 1) Unplug the US-100 and restart your DAW. 2) Run a cable from the RCA outs on the US-100 to the mini-jack aux in on your desktop speakers 3) Run a mini-jack extension cord from the headphone jack on the US-100 to the aux-in.While using the headphone jack, the RCA audio outs are muted and vis-versa. Rather than having to pull out the headphone I would prefer a push switch that toggles the front to back output, but I can live without it.Again, the US-100 works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities. You can't rely on the product description or packaging to answer that.

A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA,B00AQBT3EW,"frankp93 ""frankp93""","[0, 0]","Compared to the nickel wound XL light gauges I buy in the 3-set boxes, the ""balanced tension"" XL set amounts to slightly lighter D and A strings (.025/.026 and .034/.036 respectively, which I can feel, as well as a slightly thicker B string .0135/.013 which, frankly, I can't feel).The XLs are comparable in gauge to Ernie Ball Regular Slinky (yellow). But if you're used to Slinky's, as I was for many years, the nickel wounds feel noticeably coarser to the skin and took awhile to get used to. I love them now for blues, rock or funk, any kind of playing where you want to dig in a bit for tone - although I will say that for slide (especially when recording at relatively low volume) they don't give quite the same glassy-sounding undertone to my ears as steel wounds, something I happen to prefer.I put the XLs on an Squire Strat, which I like to bend strings on and the 5-position switch gives me a nice range of color to compare. Like the regular XLs, I noticed very little ""new string zing"" after giving them a good stretch. When my skin is dry indoors during the winter the nickels can feel rough at first but in warmer humid temps I sweat more and they get as slick as any steel wounds.I think the balanced tension is more a factor when playing chords than single lines and, for me, it's more of feel thing rather than something I hear (That doesn't make it any less significant to me - I've tossed brand new sets of strings and sold perfectly good guitars on the vague basis they didn't quite feel right).To tell the truth, when playing out I prefer an even heavier set than regular lights for tone, but at home when recording or just playing for myself I like the amount of resistance I get from the nickel wound XLs versus the Slinky's I used since I began playing as a kid. You have to work a little harder with the nickels for bends and intonation but I like the tone and feel overall and I think it's made me a more precise player.",5.0,A Little Different From Regular XL's,1363564800,"03 18, 2013"

I was simply blown away at the depth and available features on this amp.  I still am.  It's just possibly one of the best training and gigging tools for a guitarist out there.  You can play along with a drum track, with a drum AND rythmn track, and you get hundreds of presets and about 100 to make your own.  the Spyder pedals make it perfect, allowing you to turn on recording functions, drum and other functions, and also with the expression pedal, you get Wah and Volume.  The seperate tonal controls are great on this amp, and if you really dive deep into the menus, pitch shifting and timing are also available.  And with 24 minutes of looping time, that's just crazy for the price.I found it interesting that for a while, the Spyder IV 75 watter kind of dissapeared off the market in 2011 and part of 2012. It has basically the same presets of the Jam without the looper or drum and rythmn tracks, and was much less money.  I'd say it started to cut into Spyder Jam sales. I have noticed that the Spyder IV 75 watter is back now, but the Jam keeps right on going, with updates and endless support from Line 6.Even the eight year run of the Fender Cyber Twin, and Cyber Twin SE didn't offer the possibilities of the Spyder Jam, and the Cyber Twin was well over $1000 new. Yes, it has a tube preamp, and rewires itself to better simulate amps, but the Jam is SO much more in line with the budgets of up and coming guitarists. No contest, money-wise.

Baker ""KellRazor""","[9, 10]","UPDATED 3/16/2014After owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties I am revising my once gleaming review.The 2i2 is a simple set-up. Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a ""low-headroom"" instrument to it, run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters. It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton, but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless. (Ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly.) Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!I wasn't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR, an Ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, I screamed ""Ballsdogit!!!"", and purchased a license for Reaper. After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months, I began to realize that my monitors no longer ""lock up"", but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors. Now I'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers. Garbage focusrite! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface. I have yet to experience a crash, but I also have yet to experience any recording time.Seriously, I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from David@focusrite actually saying that ""you should not use this setup to record electric guitar.."", and that if you need to record electric guitar you should ""get something with more headroom like the 2i4."" That is just unbelievable in my eyes!I'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? Besides that, I'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins. There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit. I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology. HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING!!!????The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm. I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well. I constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.Sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here.",1.0,No Headroom for Electric Guitar,1351468800,"10 29, 2012"

The sound from a $40 pedal is outstanding, much better than I ever expected.The Voodoo is a fuzz pedal, meant to give a sort of Jimi Hendrix sound. This pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave. Alone it does a decent job of transforming my guitar into something like Hendrix. I was able to hold a note for two minutes with this box, the sustain is big. All was not completely perfect, it might be me and the way I'm adjusting this, but I had a bit of trouble with feedback.From a sound standpoint, this is a great value and does a good job of fuzzing up my sound. Combined with Joyo's California, Hendrix is almost in the house. (Joyo JF-15 Guitar Effect Pedal California Sound True Bypass)I have a Boss ME-70 multi-effect pedal. This Joyo single effect pedal blows away my Boss pedal, I'm almost sad to say that. I don't have experience with other single effect pedals, so I can't make a comparison to those more costly pedals.I have a Marshall Amp and cabinet with 4 x 12 inch speakers. My guitar is a Gibson Les Paul 2008 Standard Plus.From a construction standpoint, these are remarkable for the price point. The whole thing has a good weight. The base has a dense skid resistant foam rubber on it. The box is a solid cast metal box, with a very heavy metal base. The bypass and octave up switches are solid and bolted tightly to the box. The 1/4 inch input and output jacks are really sweet - there is a metal insert that screws into the plastic internal jack. It looks to me like it would be very hard to break this jack - that outer ring is heavy duty. The pots look really good. For this pedal, they went with press on knobs. If the knob ever breaks, they are a very easy replacement at Radio Shack. The only weak point is the somewhat thin Mid Cut toggle switch. Given that it is between three knobs, I think it would be hard to break this switch - but it is a little lighter weight than I would like.The pedal comes with a 9 Volt battery. It also has a standard 9V power jack on the side, to use an AC adapter or large rechargeable battery pack.This is not a high end pedal, at this price point, nobody should ever expect that.

That's part of the fun of tube-based OD. I have played a VT999 that had a great sounding overdrive, but mine didn't have that sound until I put in a new tube. Try it out with the stock tube, and go to a different tube if you don't like it. At least try a new tube before giving up.There are two things that I don't like about the VT999, and I can tell you -- both gripes have nothing to do with sound or tone. This pedal got it 100% right with tone after a tube switch. The 2 issues are:- The housing is huge, and if you look inside, it seems like a waste of space. There's a lot of open space with nothing there, and while I can concede that tubes heat up and need space to dissipate heat, it's a bit overboard.- Compared to the Fulldrive, the lack of a boost switch is really a miss. Especially given the large enclosure, it would make perfect sense to move the 5 knobs to the top half of the pedal and put a boost switch on the right hand side. That'd take little effort, and given the independent power of this pedal, would be a piece of cake to achieve. Heck, I could probably do it myself, but I don't want to ruin the good sound this produces.Bottom line, I understand that on a pedalboard, real estate is everything. This takes up at least the space of 2 pedals. Is it worth it? To me, it is. I run 2 OD pedals on my 2-row board, and I can honestly say, in the last 10 gigs, I have never gone to the other OD.

I will also say that if you can find one used - buy it. It is awonderful practice amp and can also serve well as a studio amp or a small gig amp. Ipurchased this amp about 2 years ago and love it.The Super Champ XD is considered a 'hybrid' amp. It uses solid state circuits and tubesto bring you your hybrid 15 watts of sound.  The power amp is all tube and the preampis solid state and tube. I am not real technical when it come to amps but can tell youthis amp has had some detractors and a lot of fans mainly because it is a hybrid. Thereis definitely plenty of opinions out there on the web.This amp has two channels; one clean Classic 'Blackface' tone channel and one channelthat uses digital signal processing to dial in 16 effects and 16 different amplifier voices.You can purchase a foot switch for about $25 that enable you switch between channelone and channel two.The amp also has a 1/4"" Speaker Out so you can connect an external speaker box if youso choose to increase your decibels with a bigger speaker. There is also a 1/4"" Line Outto connect recording or sound reinforcement equipment. Unfortunately, there is not aHeadphone Output or Effects Loop.The amplifier use three tubes: 1x 12AX7 and 2x 6V6s. It's speaker is a 10 inch, 8ohm'Special Design' Fender. If you want to get louder, fuller and cleaner you could replacethe stock speaker with a Eminence 'Rajin Cajun'. You can also just break in the stockspeaker and see what you think. Some players are comfortable with the stock speaker.With regard to tubes and speakers there are plenty of forums out there that talk about themods they use and the subsequent results from those mods. This is an amp you can easilymod and after a few years there have been plenty of people doing just that.I will say that the clean channel is very nice whether I play through my Gibsons or myFender Tele. I very much enjoy the clean Blackface sound of the amp. It will breakupwhen you dial up to about 4 or 5 on the Master.The Digital Voicing Processor(DSP), from what I read from more experienced players, arepretty darn close to the original. Voices like, Tweed, British (Think Vox jangle), FenderHot Rod, Metal, an Acoustic 'super clean' tone optimized for finger picking. There is alsoa clean Jazz tone that has the 'character of the Fender Jazz King amplifier'. Again, I amnot that experienced with all of these tones but many players have positivecomments about the digital voices.With regard to the Effects (Vibratone, Delay, Reverb, Chorus, and Tremolo) the opinionsout there is that they are serviceable but not authentic. It is often recommended to buya pedal specific for the effect you are looking for if you want 'authentic'.If you want or need  a highly versatile voice channel with a wonderful clean channel thisis the amp.

A3I49HMI4LV6HU,B0018TIAA4,medialint,"[1, 1]","Firstly let me address the &#34;adjustable backrest&#34;. There's nothing adjustable about the backrest. The seat moves forward and backward about two inches which actually is a considerable difference in how it feels leaning back against the backrest but the backrest itself doesn't move, the seat does. It also does not adjust up and down as you would think an &#34;adjustable&#34; backrest should. The backrest cushion actually has a hard stop top that prevents this. But the seat does adjust slightly forward and back (presumably this is the purported backrest adjustment the description repeatedly asserts) and it does adjust up and down over quite a range so adjusting for height should not be a problem. The footrest, however, is welded in place so if you plan to use the footrest you're again limited to where you can put the seat in height range.All this aside I am still giving the stool high marks because it's a fair price, it does fold down with some extra dis-assembly for transport to venues and I find it works well for me. But for how it works for me you should know: I wanted this initially to play sitting down without a strap. I found that no matter how I adjusted the stool that I was just not comfortable with how the guitar rested and so I use it now exclusively with a strap. In this way however it's actually really nice because I can use the footrest or not at will and I can also stand up, walk around and then sit back down at will. Without the strap, though, my playing dexterity is compromised by slight balancing required to keep the guitar from smashing to the floor (at least in my mind's eye).If you want a stool that folds up and goes with you this is not that stool. You do need to loosen the screws and take the seat post out and remove the backrest. Then you're left with several pieces to schlep. Not difficult but it would be tedious to do this every day.Overall though I am very happy with the way this stool feels.

I was looking for something with a great tube sound, as most of the solid-state amps that I've used (mainly fenders and line6 stuff) just don't get there. I was actually looking at the Fender Blues Junior and headed to my local GC to check 'em out and listen side-by-side.

It's still a small-fry (slightly bigger than most 15w amps out there), but much heavier.- The construction is great. I think I read some reviews that knocked the construction, but from the handle to the floor everything looks like it's built to last.- The sound is even better at home (without the GC cacophony)- Adjustments are minimal, but enough. The tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp. I've run my Strat, Tele and Taylor T5 through this. I think the hard bodies get the best blues tone, but I can get a really nice clean tone from my T5- The headphones sound great. I was really surprised by this.

A3SMT15X2QVUR8,B000SZVYLQ,"Victoria Tarrani ""writer, editor, artist, des...","[63, 63]","When I purchased this pedal from a local music store I wasn't even looking for a double pedal set, but for a replacement for the pedal that came with my Tama Stagestar kit.  During my quest for a pedal that had the feel I wanted I sat behind a Pacific drum kit that had these pedals. At first I ignored the second bass pedal and played a bit with just the right pedal and hi-hat.  I liked the feel of the right pedal and was about to ask if the store had it in a single pedal configuration when I decided to see what it was like playing double. Wow - it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities.This pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable, especially cam rotation, spring tension, and beater offset.  Most of the adjustments require a hex wrench, which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals. The left side slave pedal has a full floorplate, and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle I have tried.  There is a slight lag on the left pedal, which is normal for any double pedal configuration, but you'll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedal.Before I purchased this particular model I tried out Tama's Iron Cobra, Pearl's Powershifter and a Gilbralter Avenger.  I did not like the stiffness of the Iron Cobra, but did like the Pearl and Gibraltar pedals.  It finally came down to either this or the Gibralter, which was slightly smoother, but significantly more expensive.  I opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this pedal.If you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration I strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look.  More importantly, try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models - selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price, features and quality.  It has to feel right.  In addition, you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hi-hat, which means that you will need to compensate.  For that I recommend the Gibraltar hi-hat drop clutch (ASIN B0002F73YY), which will allow you to engage and disengage your hi-hat with ease.  I have my hi-hats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position, but stepping on the hi-hat pedal - using the clutch - puts it in full play position.  Tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again.  This clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal!",5.0,Competes with many high-end pedals,1101686400,"11 29, 2004"

The learning curve is very low, and there's no limit to the number of loops you can layer other than the total 5-minute recording time.  There are no quirky timing issues to be found here; your own ability to keep time and rhythm will always dictate how good you are at making loops.  This does take some getting used to, but it makes you a much better musician in the process; your drummer and bassist will thank you.This could possibly even be used as a live performance tool, although you'd have to be very, very proficient with this tool and be playing very, very tightly in the pocket.  I personally am not a good enough musician to ever want to risk doing something like this, lest something go wrong on stage (and lest I subsequently find myself impaled on a drumstick).Students would be especially encouraged to get one of these.

I never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my Boss.  The GoGo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner I use.  But now I have to say, I think the Snark is a little better. I bought the SN-1 and the SN-2 because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate.  The other great thing is they are chormatic, so besides being a great tuner, you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard. The display is very easy to read...better than the GoGo (although GoGo has a new improved display since I bought mine).  I love the colors and the matte finish too.  The rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners. The rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too, I had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my GoGo.

ADH0O8UVJOT10,B003AYC1SM,StormJH1,"[3, 4]","Compression is possibly one of the most misunderstood pedal (or rack) effects for guitar players, but I can say confidently that the MXR Custom Comp gets it right, and makes it easy.WHAT IT DOES - First, a quick word about compression.  The easiest way to describe compression is that smooths and sustains the level and intensity of your guitar's pure tone.  When you play an uncompressed guitar signal, you can experience annoying volume swells if you strum too aggressively.  On the other side of the problem, you may want to use strummed chords or arpeggiated sequences for a continuous ""ringing"" effect, but find that the individual notes die out too soon.  A quality compressor pedal takes those extremes and normalizes them.  It also can ""sustain"" the notes by boosting the levels of individual chords or notes when they would otherwise fade away, depending on the settings.BUILD QUALITY - If there are complaints to be had about the MXR Custom Comp, they aren't related to durability.  MXR pedals, like BOSS pedals, are built with heavy-duty metal, yet the pedal is surprisingly light with the battery removed.  Unlike BOSS pedals, the switch is in the form of a metal button that ""clicks"" when you press it.  My understanding from veteran MXR users is that the switch is very reliable and long-lasting.  In my case, however, I intend on having the thing on all the time, so this is not a major concern anyway.One gripe with the pedal is the accessibility of the battery and internal ""Attack"" control.  The pedal has knobs for Output (volume) and Sensitivity (basically, amount of compression).  The ""Attack"" knob, which is found on some rival compressors, has to do with the degree of ""pick attack"" sound you want when you first hit the note, and whether the sound comes on aggressiveness or more subtly.  But on the MXR Custom Comp, you need to remove the back plate (4 Phillips screws) and adjust the Attack know with a screwdriver.  You also need to remove the back plate to get to the battery, though I've switched to a power adapter/daisy chain (OneSpot) for my pedals anyway.  So, yes, it's an inconvenience, but with this type of effect, it's not like you would want to adjust the Attack the way you would mess with Tone or Gain on a distortion pedal.  I consider this also to be a non-issue.TONE/SOUND QUALITY - The sound quality of this effect is outstanding.  It is far more ""transparent"" than other pedals I've tried in terms of retaining the tonal characteristics of my guitar, but leveling everything out for a great ""finishing touch"".  Whereas I used to think of compression as an ""effect"" I would turn on for a specific type of tone, I could envision always leaving this effect on with the MXR Custom Comp.  It simply makes my underlying clean tone and other effects more manageable and better sounding.COMPARISON TO OTHER PEDALS - The toughest question to ask about the MXR Custom Comp is whether it is worth the extra money.  The top-end professional compressors (Keeley pedals, rack units, etc.) are usually north of $200, which isn't practical for a casual player.  Boss makes the CS-3 Compression Sustainer, which is the pedal I traded in for the Custom Comp.  The CS-3 is more affordable (about $50 to $75 new) and more customizable, with 4 knobs on the exterior of the pedal, adding ""Attack"" and ""Sustain"".  It definitely does the job in terms of adding sustain, and might make sense if you only want to play around with compression from time to time.  But much like with MXR's entry level compressor (The Dyna Comp in the red casing), it simply isn't up to the quality of this pedal.ADVICE - While compression doesn't ""color"" your guitar tone the way a distortion pedal does, it's arguably as important to your overall tone quality as any other pedal.  If you're interested in compression and want the best option at an affordable price, I recommend the Custom Comp at $100 or less on Amazon, or used on eBay, where I've seen it go for about $70 to $85.  It may not be ""necessary"" for everyone, but very few people who try it will come away disappointed.  Turn it on, play with the settings for a minute or two, and then leave it on and strum away.",5.0,Finishing touch to a professional sound (at a less-than-professional price),1347926400,"09 18, 2012"
ADH0O8UVJOT10,B004FEGXDK,StormJH1,"[1, 1]","There is no shortage of ""Tubescreamer clones"" on the market for guitarists in search of that warm overdriven tube sound perfect for blues, jazz, and rock.  The DigiTech Bad Monkey is one such example.  But the Chinese-made Joyo JF-01 Vintage Distortion just be the best, and it's half the price of a TS-9.About the manufacturer - Joyo hit the market a couple of years back and has now released about a couple dozen pedals that utilize their own form factor (very similar to an MXR in size and switch) but ""cloning"" the circuitry of well-known classic and modern boutique effects pedals.  Some people jump to conclusions about Chinese products, but don't just take it from me - do your homework.  The response to these pedals has been overwhelmingly positive, and there are great vendors/distributors within the U.S. that test them out and can ship them to you within a few days.  I'm definitely a fan of Joyo products.As for the ""Vintage Distortion"" itself, people have said it's based on either a TS-9 or the (more expensive) TS-808.  Frankly, while the latter is apparently warmer (and less mid-range heavy) than the former, I'm not sure there's any significant difference.  I played this JF-01 side by side with my TS-9, and it's probably one of the more exact ""clones"" in the Joyo lineup.  For example, the Joyo ""Ultimate Drive"" is an excellent (higher-gain) overdrive pedal based on a Fulltone OCD, but you can still notice differences in the resulting sound and settings required to get there (some of which are arguably BETTER than the original).  With the settings matched, the JF-01 performed almost exactly like the TS-9 in level, gain, and tone.  There probably is little more gain available on this pedal with that knob cranked full, which isn't a bad thing.  It's very responsive to your playing style and, again, it sounds like a Tubescreamer.I'll probably be keeping my Tubescreamer, if only because it's an iconic pedal that performs well.  But it's superior in name only - if I had to use the Joyo Vintage Overdrive in its place, I'd be no worse for the wear.  5 stars, highly recommended!",5.0,Nearly indistinguishable from a TS-9 Tubescreamer...and $40.,1349481600,"10 6, 2012"
ADH0O8UVJOT10,B004Z8VQ2O,StormJH1,"[0, 0]","I really can't say enough positive things about the Apogee JAM.  Not even 3 years ago, I would have considered recording into an iPad or iPhone to be a &#34;novelty&#34;, and the interface products that most people use to hook up your guitar as &#34;gimmicks&#34; or &#34;toys&#34;.  Now, as of 2013/14, we have so many quality modeling programs, recording DAW's, and AudioBus to connect them to one another.  Whether you're a budding professional, or just a hobbyist aiming to record your own covers, the Apogee JAM (usually around $99.99) deserves a serious look.PROS -Extremely easy to use and widely compatible --&#62; No batteries required.  You get a small plastic converter with an 1/4&#34; input (for guitar cable) on one end and a digital output for 30-pin connector, Lightning, or Mac cables, all of which are included.  Virtually any serious guitar recording app in iOS (GarageBand, Agile AmpKit, AmpliTube, JamUp XT) will recognize and work with the Apogee JAM right out of the box.Crystal clear digital sound --&#62; The sound quality you get through the digital input is markedly better than using the headphone jack as an input.  You'll hear your guitar as it's meant to be heard, and with far less hissing and junk in the background.Considerably less feedback --&#62; This was actually the primary reason I decided to upgrade.  My Positive Grid JamUp Plug wasn't disappointing me in sound quality, but there was so much additional noise that went with it, it would easily cause my modeling amps in Agile AmpKit+ to feed back.  High gain settings (even something basic like a Marshall JCM900) were practically unusable.  Even with clean settings, I had the noise filter turned WAY up, and that still didn't thwart the feedback issues.  The Apogee JAM cured ALL of that instantly.  When I first plugged it in, I wasn't even sure it was on because I expected to hear constant hissing in the background.  What I assumed was a fault of the software was actually due to a poor interface.  The JAM's improvement in avoiding feedback, alone, made it worth its price.No &#34;crosstalk&#34; - When you do multi-track recording with a headphone jack splitter, you get a bleed-over effect referred to as cross-talk.  Basically, you are using the headphone input to monitor and play along with your track, but due to poor circuitry, this also gets fed back into the &#34;armed&#34; track you are recording.  Some people are bothered by this more than others, but it makes quality multi-track recording quite challenging.  I haven't noticed any of that using the Apogee JAM whatsoever, since it is a digital connection.  (You can still monitor your playing using the iPad's headphone jack separately, obviously).Gain control and LED gauge --&#62; Not a feature unique to the JAM, but I love how it's implemented.  When you first plug in the device, the LED light is blue to show that it is hooked up, but not being utilized by software.  Once the input is active in software, the light becomes green.  However, as you play and hit harder notes, the light may change to yellow/orange, or even red.  If it is getting into the red, your input level is too high, and may overdrive the signal.  You adjust this right on the JAM using a roller dial.  I tend to aim for a setting where the light is largely green and starts to touch yellow only in the more aggressive parts.  Works well.CONS -Price point is a little high --&#62; Admittedly, I wasn't thrilled about having to spend $99.99 for what I was already doing with a $20 headphone jack.  That being said, I researched all of the alternatives and repeatedly heard that this was the best.  If I knew it would be as good as it is, the price would have been of little concern.  Also, there aren't really any quality DIGITAL options that are significantly cheaper.Lightweight plastic design --&#62; I actually have no problem with the build quality of the JAM, or that it is made out of plastic.  At the same time, the fact that it is relatively lightweight means that your guitar cable may pull it off of a table.  I also would not advise stepping on it if it happens to fall on the floor.  But they do include two velcro strips to fasten it, and it's a problem you can address with common sense.Highly recommend the Apogee JAM.

My performance guitar is a Martin HD-28 and my practice guitar is a Blueridge BR-180.I wanted a third guitar just for kicks.  I'd been looking a Taylors, but didn't want to spend that much money.Enter the Seagull S6.  A fellow picker asked if I'd ever heard of a Seagull - I hadn't - he said they were nice guitars and I ought to check them out.  So, I did a little research.  I first read all the nice reviews here for the S6 and then went on YouTube and listened to a few.  My guitar is a Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 and I really like it. I choose not to get the cedar top version because the cedar is soft, and I understand that the spruce has more volume. I got the S6 today and this evening my wife, with her Taylor GS Mini, and I, with this S6, played Smokey Mountain Memories.  Nice, real nice guitar.I found that the action on this S6 is pretty good out of the box.  I'm going to take it to my luthier tomorrow and have him install a strap pin/peg on the heel and take a look at the action at the same time, if he can make the action better, I'll let him.  I'm also going to put on some Elixir Light strings.  I don't know what kind of strings are on it out of the box.But, the bottom line is that I am very happy with the playablilty and the action of this Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 acoustic guitar right out of the box.
